DunkinDonuts,Idk how to add multiple pics but there‚Äôs a hurricane and pretty soon we won‚Äôt be able to go anywhere,Most of FL probably won‚Äôt get to redeem the free coffee tomorrow
DunkinDonuts,"Yesterday was my third day at Dunkin. I'm starting to learn the lattes now, since I've already memorized all the hot and iced drinks/flavors/etc. On top of that, I got scheduled to come in way earlier than before for training, so I ended up clocking in about an hour before lunch rush... yikes! 

I tried to hold my own, and I honestly think I did pretty good (except for jot knowing much about the lattes, leading to me messing up twice and then just relegating myself to being the cup distributor... so embarrassing). Suddenly, an order comes through for an iced coffee. I think -- great! I can do this! I put in the shots and the swirls, the right amount of creams, feeling good!

Then I go to hand it out the drive through, my kindest smile on display, and then...

""It's supposed to have cold foam."" 

My mind goes blank. I apologize, copy the ""I'll get that for you right away!"" I've heard my coworkers say, and retract right back into the drive through window like a frightened turtle. A coworker hands me the cold foam right as I turn around, so I pop the lid off the drink and add in the best layer of cold foam my slightly-panicked hands can manage. 

Then I grab a different lid so the foam won't get squashed, and the worst thing happens. 

The lid won't go on. 

These lids have been giving all of us trouble the entire day. And now, when I'm already behind, it won't go on the cup.

I press and push and squeeze the cup to no avail. It's not budging. So I turn around to look for the one person who's been able to put the lid on with ease -- our boss, Michael.

He's not there. He's in the back, doing boss things in his little supply-closet-office. He's got security cameras back there for the lobby and kitchen; I briefly wonder if he's been watching me battle this godforsaken lid as I (carefully) pick up the drink and run to the back of the store. 

""Michaaaeeeeelllll, help meeeeee"" is what he hears as I appear in his office doorway. He laughs, spinning around in his chair, and confirms my wonderings -- ""I was watching you on the camera."" 

Pop! The lid goes on in seconds, and I take the drink with a quick thank-you. Rush back to the drive through window, open it up, and hand out the drink with a sheepish apology for the wait. 

Lady scoffs, snatches the drink, and speeds away. 

:( I'm sorry, ma'am, I swear I triiiiiiiiied!! 

Tldr; I'm a new employee. Forgot a customer's cold foam, then couldn't get the lid on after I added it. Had to spend some time getting my boss to do it. Customer wasn't happy :(",First angry customer :(

Frankly I‚Äôm just after the sip lid so I said fine whatever could I have a med iced pumpkin with cold foam? And I pull up and they give me a pumpkin with no cold foam and a straw. Naturally.

If this is a strict rule why have I been ordering it every day for so long without a word lol. I understand maybe this is because of how they price out the drink or she didn‚Äôt know how to use the cash register enough to price it out but like come on lol it‚Äôs hardly a customization I just want cold foam on top and I‚Äôm willing to pay for it.

So I said ok could I just order a medium iced pumpkin hazelnut with cream and add cold foam and this woman still said no. What the heck.

DunkinDonuts,"So, I've been getting dunkin donuts cold brew for a long time, atleast a year. I've never had a problem until yesterday. 

Yesterday I ordered my cold brew the same way I always do, 4 cream and 4 pumps of liquid sugar. The coffee was wa sweeter than what I had ordered but I drank it anyway because caffeine. After I drank half of it over the next couple of hours, I began having an allergic reaction. 

Coffee was the only thing I injested yesterday before the afternoon so I figured the store may have put almond milk in my coffee by mistake. My issue is that I had what I think is another mild allergic reaction today from my coffee from a different location. 

My issue is that I don't know why I was having this reaction. Did both locations make that mistake? Or is there something else I am allergic to. 

Does anyone have a list of ingredients or brands of ingredients so I can check into it? 

My coffee is usually a medium cold brew with 4 cream and 4 liquid sugar, so I am looking for information on the coffee, the cream, and the liquid sugar. 

Thank you in advance, anything helps.",Allergies and allergens?
DunkinDonuts,"I'm a shift leader ...well I've been in training since June for shift leader and they're taking their sweet time to certify me even though I'm doing all the work. I think they just don't feel like giving me the raise. They have me scheduled as DD shift leader plus. I have shift leader access in the POS...etc. But I digress

Me and the other shift leader who is in the same position do more work than my manager. Like way more work. Whenever the two of us aren't here and she has to run the store, we walk into a mess the next time we come in. I'm talking no change in the safe, nothing portioned, we're out of everything, and there's a million deposits bc she just doesn't do the bank deposits....

So she just hired this new girl ...who's her friend on Facebook. Because of course.  And she just started this week and she's been on two night shifts so far. In a few days I have to open with her. We only get 30 minutes to open until we have to unlock the door. We go in at 4:30 and open at 5. (which means we have to rush to try to get everything done so that we can serve people even though we literally do not have enough time for that)

I told my manager I don't think it's fair that I have to open with her when she's never opened before. My manager says 
""It's your job to train her""

Okay but TRAINING usually means she gets put on with two people who are opening so she can learn and we can work at the same time...I don't think it's fair or realistic that I have to train her and open the store with just the two of us in 30 minutes. Not only am I doing my job, I'm doing the other openers job, and I'm doing the job of training her all at the same time. 

I'm angry and my manager keeps telling me it's my job to train her and that I have to ""step up"" even though I literally do more for the store than her....am I in the wrong?",am I in the wrong for not wanting to open alone with a new employee who has never opened before?

DunkinDonuts,I was at a Dunkin and someone was ordering a hot medium ‚ÄúLight and Sweet‚Äù I think this is more of a mass thing so this Dunkin (Maryland) had never heard of it before. Both the customer and the employee seemed confused. I told them to put in 2x the regular cream and sugar. What would you do?,How many cream and sugar for ‚ÄúLight and Sweet‚Äù?
DunkinDonuts,[removed],Making Dunkin iced coffee at home!
DunkinDonuts,,"Hi, can I get an iced regulah and a strahberry frahsted?"
DunkinDonuts,"So i get at least one large iced coffee every day. I'm lactose intolerant so I always get oatmilk. Usually order in the app because I notice the employees often make mistakes, like giving me cream and oatmilk both instead of subbing. One time, my boyfriend wants to get me a treat at night (this dunkin is open til 10) so he can surprise me when I get off work. He ordered a signature latte with oatmilk. They charged him 4 whole dollars just for the milk, a dollar per shot in a large. We went back and talked to a girl the next day and she offered a free coffee. All was well. 

Another night comes and im ordering in the drive thru because I was too distracted to use the app on the way there. They want to charge 10 dollars for a signature latte because they're charging a full dollar per shot of oatmilk. I asked them why it's so expensive since I order it for a much smaller upcharge in app. She said it was policy. I mentioned that the last time I asked for a manager, she told us that it was a mistake. She goes on to explain that she also works as a manager at a resort business for some reason then says the other manager wad wrong and that their regional manager wants them to upcharge that much for the milk. I offer to cancel the order and place it in mobile if that's the process that works but she gets upset and insists on just amending the price this time since we're regulars but warns us to expect it next time. 

Those of you who work at dunkin, do you know of an increased upcharge for things like that or was she just lying and being sketchy about it? It seems odd to charge a full dollar per shot when signature lattes are a blanket upcharge of 1 dollar in the app. I used to work customer service so I know how this stuff can be. If I'm in the wrong, I'd like to move on with adjusted expectations. But if she's just overcharging me because she wasn't trained correctly or something, I don't think I should have to jump hoops to get a fair price on a coffee.",Weird new upcharge policy?
DunkinDonuts,"2 parts. 
1. I am acting as a store manager (doing all of the duties as one with no supervisor) but getting paid as an ASM. Was told I was on a 3 month ""training period"" to see if I could do it. I have been training with no one. Am I getting screwed over? 

2. My district manager constantly makes people come in sick and tell my ASM to work with her kids in the office when she cant bring them to daycare. She cant not come in to work because we are that understaffed. 

Weve both been working 10+ hours over time. I am not getting paid extra for it because this is the ""expectation"" for store managers.

The hot Dunkaccinos were my favorite drink, and now all of my Dunkins seemingly have finally gotten rid of them. Yes, I did live in a place where we still had them until like, a week ago. 

I'm not used to drinking straight-up coffee with random flavor shots, nor do I speak ""coffee"". In short, I have no idea what I'm doing. Take for instance this morning where I ordered a mocha with a caramel shot and like, 2 creams bc I didn't understand what I was doing. It does not taste... great at all. 

I'm wondering if anyone has an order I can do that would taste somewhat like a Dunkaccino? As close as I can get? Sadly it seems like even some Dunkins around me don't even have the ability to make hot chocolates anymore either so I don't think I can use that to my advantage right now. 

Short of just making the Dunkaccino at home with replica recipes, which I don't always have the time to do ‚Äî¬†just looking for an order I can say at the drive-thru that's close enough to a Dunkaccino where it doesn't taste like I'm drinking straight-up coffee and it's just as satisfying.

I've been making sure to properly clean the drains for months even tho it's almost impossible because we have sewage backup constantly and half of our drains are so stopped up that theres no room to pour any cleaner in them without it immediately coming back up!  

And they keep understaffing us. My manager told me today ""labor looks a little high today send someone home"" because it was raining and we had less customers than usual.

DunkinDonuts,"I'm a shift leader at a Dunkin. We have a fruit fly infestation every summer. Most of the time it's because the air conditioning breaks every year, and we have to choose between sweating to death or opening the back door for flies to come in.

This year, however, they fixed the AC on July (because the district manager had to actually spend time in the store to train a new manager so she finally saw that it was 95 Fahrenheit in here and decided she should do something because she's suffering) 

Anyways we haven't been keeping the back door open but we still have a lot of fruit flies. We all know about it. But nobody will do anything about it. I've tried to have the crew clean like crazy but they keep only putting 3 people on for days and we literally don't even get time to take breaks (even though my manager keeps taking the breaks out of our paycheck) 

So we can't clean...not even at night bc they keep complaining about labor so day crew has to vanish as soon as their shift is over and we can't clean up so night crew has to clean our mess. 

Every now and then I try to clean out the drains but most of the drains are so filled with stuff that they don't even DRAIN. This is something thats also been a problem for years. 

The thing that threw me over the edge today was finding a fruit fly crawling on sandwich station. It immediately made me want to close the store down. And then...I found one in the coffee cup I was preparing. Just drowning in the cream. 

I know that the only way anything will happen is if someone calls someone outside of the store to do something about it. Because they've been known about it and haven't done anything besides get 1 trap like 2 months ago.... 

My manager said ""we have to get really good with cleaning"" but we're literally trying our best but they won't staff us! 

And I ain't never seen her pick up a broom. 

Are all Dunkin franchises like this????","who should I call about a two month long, (yearly recurring) fruit fly infestation?"

DunkinDonuts,A old coworker showed me this drink that tasted amazing when done right. Get a cup with ice and a sprite form the cooler.the pour it on the cup and add as many blueberry shots as you like. Then add a pump or to of the blueberry coolatta swirl. Mix it and add lemon.

DunkinDonuts,So my dunkin is located pretty much in the middle of the city and there is a lot of homeless people around. I don‚Äôt have trouble with them most of them are pretty chill with me and respect me. When I first started I would give out a donut or two at the end rarely a drink. But some people would just want to take advantage of that nice act of your and almost demand for free sh^t. And I‚Äôm not a person that would let that slide so I say no and argue with some if they try to. But for the most part I stay away from trouble because I know better. Anyway there is a new coworker that is giving out way to much free meals to them to get in there ‚Äúcool side‚Äù but really they are using my coworker. I have told him already and he doesn‚Äôt listen so I will just let Maneger handle that. any thoughts?,Why I don‚Äôt give out free sh*t no more!

DunkinDonuts,"  So I can‚Äôt blame anyone for ordering them at all because they are absolutely delicious, particularly the egg white and veggie variety. However, oh my lord those packages they come in are an absolute nightmare to open.

I‚Äôve never had anything put me behind as much as the omelette bites. Especially considering that they take much long to cook than most items to make. 

 Every once and a while one will be really easy to open but that is only them luring you into a false sense of security. They would be easy to make if they were all like that.

I have recently been trying to saw the package open with a knife though that is not an easy feat as they are also incredibly delicate.

I try to pre make them when I can but they aren‚Äôt quite popular enough to do that without the risk of having to throw a bunch a way at the end of the night, which would just be sad and wasteful.

DunkinDonuts,"I have an interview with Dunkin Donuts in a few days. The job is a crew member. My responsibilities will include but will not be limited to thoroughly cleaning tables, obeying safety and sanitation guidelines, handling cash register transactions and pouring coffee. 

I have done research to find out what types of questions I can expect to receive during the interview. Below is a list of possible questions and the answers I have drafted. I will gladly accept any feedback. It is doubtful that every single one of these questions would be asked, but some of them will and I don‚Äôt know which ones will and which ones won‚Äôt be asked, so I need to be prepared. Please focus not on how likely it is that I will be asked these questions, but on whether or not the answers I have drafted would make sense had these questions been asked. 

**What are your strengths**?

I am a quick learner. I am enthusiastic and hungry to learn. Furthermore, I take criticism really well. If I have done something wrong, I want to be told what I did wrong. Therefore, you will never have to worry about me making the same mistake twice. 

**What is your biggest weakness**? 

With what little work experience I have, I am a work in progress. However, being so new to this profession, I can be shaped into the perfect employee. 

**What are your career goals**?

At the moment, I am in a discovery phase. In an attempt to find myself, I want a job that will remind me about the value of hard work and enable me to challenge myself. I hope to be able to multitask, so that I may learn, grow and develop. 

**Where do you see yourself five years from now**? 

Five years from now, I plan to still be working here. Hopefully, I will have contributed to the company enough to be seen as a trusted and reliable member of my team. While still in the ame role, I would have a wide range of responsibilities. I would be the go to person for advice and expertise in my area. 

**When are you available to work**?

I am available to work anytime. 

**Tell me about yourself**.

There is so much to tell, it is hard to know where to begin. 

In undergrad, I completed an internship working on nightly and weekend programming. This job enabled me to work with students who had learning disabilities. I would help to coordinate events. I would help with the set up and clean up. During the event itself, I would interact with the students and ensure that they were having a good time and obeying all school rules. If I am hired to work at Dunkin Donuts, it would be my job to ensure that the customers have a pleasant experience. 

**Walk me through your resume**.  

I have done landscaping jobs before. I once shovelled snow out of the driveway of a customer who was unable to shovel himself due to back problems. I was self-employed and the pay was not steady. I had to seek out opportunities for work. I did not have the same sense or order that I would have at a job that takes place in a building where I punch in and punch out. That is why I would like a job like this, where I am told when to show up and what to do when I am here. 

I recently finished school. My major was psychology. I knew that the courses that I took in school were no guarantee of figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. However, by understanding human nature, I would be able to better understand the world, which would help me connect with people and figure out how to find work. 

My last semester of undergrad, I worked an unpaid internship on nightly and weekend programming for the Thames program. The Thames program at Mitchell College is a program for students with learning disabilities. I assisted with the prep work, set up and cleaned up for many events. During these events, I would interact with and act as a role model for younger students. As an intern, there was a degree of creativity involved with the job, but for the most part, I followed orders given to me by my supervisor. I foresee this job as one that is mostly about obeying an employer. I intend to set up the place to open and/or clean up the place before leaving after closing. 

**How did you hear about this job**?

I received an email notification from Indeed.com. I like challenges. This job is physically demanding, because you have to lift objects that weigh as much as 35 pounds. The job is also socially challenging, you must greet customers and ensure that people have a pleasant experience when the people in question are complete strangers and you do not know what they like. This job sounds challenging in a good way. This job sounds exactly like a challenging task I have been looking for this whole time. 

**Why do you want to work at this company**? 

I want to work at Dunkin Donuts, because the clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. 

This restaurant's target demographic is the working class. These are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. I take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average American. 

**Why should we hire you**? 

My biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that I am a team player. In a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. Having majored in Behaviour Science in undergrad, I have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. When I did community service for Sacred Heart School in Taftville, I would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. Therefore, I know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. Also, I was a student-athlete in high school. From this experience, I built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**When did you have to work under stress? How did you handle it**?

When I completed an internship in undergrad, I had to complete 100 hours by the end of the semester. I dealt with that stress the same way I dealt with any other form of stress, by using the one year rule. If ever I am stressed about anything, I simply ask myself, will this still be on my mind in a year? If the answer is no, then logically there is no reason to be worried, as it will all blow over in 365 days or less. If, however, the answer is yes, then there is still no reason to be worried, as even if things do not go as planned, there will be plenty more opportunities to rectify what went wrong. I also ask myself this one question. What is the worst thing that can happen? Stress is what you feel when you are not sure what the outcome will be and you know that the outcome could be undesirable. When you take a driving test, you feel stressed, because you might not pass. If you ask yourself what the worst thing that can happen is, you may be surprised to discover that the worst thing that can happen is not only pretty unlikely to happen in the first place, if it were to happen, it would not be that bad. 

**Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team**? 

I like to work as part of a team. I also enjoy working alone with close supervision. When I did my internship in college, I would interact with my supervisors, the other interns and my teacher. It was all up to me to ensure that I fulfilled my responsibilities. I was supervised in regards to the jobs that I did for the school, but it was my responsibility to ensure that my work was completed in time. 

**How would you deal with a conflict**?

If ever I dealt with a conflict, whether it be work related or inter personal, I would say to the other person the following; 

‚ÄúIt seems to me that you are upset or angry that something has been done wrong. Would you please tell me what I have done wrong, why it was wrong and what, if anything, can be done to improve the situation?‚Äù 

That is verbatim what I would say in response to a complaint.

**How would you remain motivated in your work**?

I consistently ask myself; Am I a better person than I was a year ago? And what do I need to do to become better over the course of the next 365 days? I think of it in terms of years, not days. Everyone has bad days. You don‚Äôt know if you will improve from one day to the next, but there is no excuse for regressing from one year to the next. 

**What is your ideal working environment**?

My ideal working environment is one where everyone makes it a priority to build others up. No one is perfect. When a fellow worker makes a mistake, the appropriate response is to either correct the mistake or teach the person who made the mistake to correct it himself or herself. This expectation should apply in all directions, employee toward employer, employer toward employee and employee toward other employee.  

**Is there anything you have done in the past that you wish you had done differently**? 

When I did community service for Sacred Heart school, I was tasked with vacuuming the carpets. I unplugged the vacuum cleaner before turning it off. I received a shock.  

**If you have a day when you are not busy, what would you do**?

I would ask my supervisor if anything else needs to be done, hoping he or she has a task for me. 

**Why is it important for all policies and standards to be obeyed**?

Policies, procedures and standards are set in place with the intent to work toward a common goal. If some people in a staff or faculty disobey policies, a common goal will never be achieved. 

**When can you start? When are you available**?

I am capable of beginning immediately. I am available to work any shift. 

**Are you able to travel**? 

Although I do not have my own vehicle, I will have transportation for scheduled shifts. 

**Do you have any experience working in fast food**? 

I do not. 

**Why are you interested in working with us**? 

I am a regular customer of Dunkin Donuts. Every product, the donuts, coffee, hot chocolate, and breakfast sandwiches are amazing. I am impressed by the quality of the products, not to mention the customer service. If I work here, I can spread joy through a cup of coffee and make customers loyal to the brand. Furthermore, the fast paced environment is my ideal workplace. 

**What do you know about the company**? 

When William Rosenberg founded Dunkin Donuts in 1950, the company first did business in Quincy Massachusetts. The slogan ‚ÄúAmerica runs on Dunkin‚Äù is accurate. It is the most popular coffee seller in the country, measured by the number of coffee cups sold. Dunkin Donuts sells over 2 billions cups of coffee in a single calendar year. 

**Why us and not our competitors**? 

As a loyal customer of Dunkin Donuts, I know that Dunkin Donuts produces products of much higher quality at a lower price compared to other companies. Year after year, Dunkin Donuts has not dropped in quality at all. The clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. This restaurant's target demographic is the working class. These are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. I take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average American. 

**Why should we hire you**? 

My biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that I am a team player. In a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. Having majored in Behaviour Science in undergrad, I have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. When I did community service for Sacred Heart School in Taftville, I would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. Therefore, I know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. Also, I was a student-athlete in high school. From this experience, I built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**How would you deal with an unsatisfied customer**? 

I would offer my condolences, ask why the experience was unpleasant and ask what, if anything, I am capable of doing to remedy the situation so that it never occurs again. If it is possible to fulfil the customer‚Äôs request while obeying the rules set in place by my employer, I will do so. 

**Can you work under pressure**? 

I can definitely work under pressure. Pressure makes me a more competent worker. When I completed an internship in undergrad, the knowledge that I had to complete 100 hours of service by the end of the semester gave me the incentive I needed to reach out to people and ask if there were any favours they needed. When my professor told me that failure to complete 100 hours would result in an F for the course and course credit being withheld, I immediately knew that I needed to reach out and seek opportunities as soon as possible. 

**What do you foresee being the biggest challenge at this job**? 

I have always wanted to work here and never given much thought to the challenges that are likely to come up. I imagine I will face the typical challenges associated with a fast paced environment. I am sure that it will be nothing unsolvable. When I face a challenge or I am out of my comfort zone, there is no need to talk about how uncomfortable I am. My discomfort is my problem, no one else‚Äôs. I will deal with the discomfort myself one time. When talking to others I will focus on the positive. 

**What would you do if a customer asked to speak to the manager**? 

I would first ask what the problem is and whether or not I can help. If I can help, I will. If, however, I lack the ability to solve the problem myself or the customer insists on seeing the manager, then I will get the manager immediately. 

**How reliable are you**? 

I pride myself in always showing up and time, doing my best and receiving all the constructive criticism that is useful to me. If I am unable to show up, I intend to give my employer and coworkers notice well in advance. 

**How do you intend to provide excellent customer service**? 

I will always provide service with a smile. In other words, have a positive perky attitude when greeting a customer. I will lead the customer to a seat for an in house order. To ensure that the customer is attended to in a timely manner, I will be sure to sit or stand in a location where I can easily identify a customer and a customer could easily identify me. 

**What would you do if you caught a fellow employee stealing from the cash register**? 

I do not tolerate unethical behaviour such as stealing. I will report the theft in such a way as standard procedure dictates. This is rarely an issue for me in the first place, as the vast majority of people who I have ever met have proper respect for other people‚Äôs property. 

**How do you achieve proper work-life balance**? 

When I am not at work, I throw myself into my hobbies. I enjoy athletic activities like hiking, leisure activities like playing video games and intellectually stimulating activities such as reading classic novels and writing movie reviews. 

**What would you do if a customer ordered in house and refused to pay**? 

I hope I never have to deal with that, but should such an unfortunate circumstance arise, I would speak to security or management, who are trained to handle such situations. 

**What have you done to better your understanding of this field in the last five years**? 

In school, I took several classes in psychology and marketing. This taught me a lot about the economy, customer service, human nature and how to behave professionally. 

**How would you prioritise tasks during a busy period**?

The customer always comes first. 

If I am in the middle of setting a table and a party enters as the phone is ringing, I would drop what I am doing, escort the customer to their table, answer the phone and then finish setting the table in that order. 

**How do you intend to blend with our existing team**? 

I have pretty good communication and people skills. I respect people‚Äôs boundaries. If the employee is more experienced than I am, I will look to him or her for guidance

**Do you have any questions for me**? (This is what the interviewer will ask). 

A year from now, assuming that all goes as planned and I get this job, what will I have to have done to make you glad that you hired me? How will I know if I have done a good job?",Are these good answers for potential interview questions?

DunkinDonuts,,Am I the only one?
DunkinDonuts,"Hi Dunkin,

I have a Dunkin‚Äô donuts near my place of work, where I pick up ‚Äúcold brews‚Äù 2-5 times a week. I‚Äôm not a huge coffee snob, but I did work at Dunkin in college, and can easily distinguish between cold brew and iced coffee. Dunkin‚Äôs iced coffee is much more bitter, more watered down, a slightly lighter color, and leaves bean dust floating in the bottom of your drink. Cold brew, being around a dollar more, is higher quality and tastes better (imo).

So I guess here‚Äôs where the snobbiness comes in‚Ä¶ I can tell that I often get iced coffee in my ‚Äúcold brew‚Äù, and it quite honestly ruins my day. Some days it‚Äôs just straight undrinkable, or full of bean floaties, or an odd grayish color (presumably because it‚Äôs watered down remaining iced coffee). I‚Äôve tried clarifying that it is cold brew, I‚Äôve tried asking the cashier if they still have cold brew before I order, I‚Äôve even asked the barista which they used. I have never asked for a remake, and I‚Äôm really trying to avoid that, but I will lose my freaking mind if I wind up with another ‚Äúcold brew‚Äù that tastes like coffee piss on ice.

When it comes down to it, if the cashier would honestly tell me that cold brew was out, I simply wouldn‚Äôt buy it that day. I‚Äôm much more a Starbucks gal, but this dunkin is the sole remaining covid survivor in my area. It‚Äôs my only option for coffee I didn‚Äôt make myself. I‚Äôm not trying to be an asshole, I definitely don‚Äôt want to make the employees miserable‚Ä¶.. but how on earth can I get them to be honest with me about the contents of the ‚Äúcold brew‚Äù, and is there any way to avoid a weekly gamble? Is it okay to complain? Is it fine to ask for a remake/ refund? I know I hated remaking drinks, but then again, I took the high road and told my customers when I was out of cold brew‚Ä¶.

Anyway, friendly reminder to all, customers CAN tell the difference when you sub in the cheaper products. If you‚Äôre out of something, please be honest. If you mess up, please correct it. All I want is my cashier to honestly tell me when they‚Äôre out of cold brew - that‚Äôs it. But instead, I get constant promises that it is indeed cold brew‚Ä¶. and half the time, it‚Äôs not.",Consistently given iced coffee instead of cold brew?
DunkinDonuts,"Ok, tell me this isn‚Äôt weird. Almost every time I go to my local Dunkin, they take a huge, banged up metal pan, shove it through the window and scrape the asphalt with it after a car drives off. After several times seeing them do this, I asked the guy why. He said that they do it to ‚Äúgrab the change that fell on the ground‚Äù ??? but each time I see them do it, there is no change in the ground and they sure as hell ain‚Äôt picking it up with that thing.",Local Dunkin scrapes metal pan on ground at drive-thru

I recently took 2 gap years for personal reasons, and I don't have the best references. I'm going to ask for 55k for a management position or 42k for an assistant manager position. I want to be NETTING at least 36k, so if I'm not, I also plan on taking on a second job, is this allowed at Dunkin? I applied to another manager position at a different location for assistant manager, interviewed a couple weeks ago, and the woman told me that she would gave to start me as a crew member in order for me to get the assistant manager position- is this normal? She then said for crew member she could only start me at 13/hr and if I get the assistant manager position the highest she could go is 16/hr, so I noped out of that and ceased contact. I guess she passed along my information to a hiring manager at another location closer to me, who yesterday texted me about the management position they gave open and asked me to interview today. I know if I'm hired I will do a good job, but with my gap year and lack of good references I understand why they may be hesitant to start me off with my salary expectations, but I know it would feel degrading to me to take less, since I am 25 years old and need to pay bills and am not getting an inheritance (I come from a fiscally irresponsible home and am 100% on my own), so im basically fucked if I don't make a living wage.. like actually homeless once my one and only family member, who is 77, dies.","Interviewing for manager position today, is my pay expectation reasonable?"

But y'all I'm kind of disappointed. To me it lacked flavor. The best part was the cinnamon sugar sprinkle on top. Am I just being a Karen?

DunkinDonuts,"This is just me ranting, but I'm losing my mind.

When I first started working at Dunkin, I loved it. There were some hiccups, with me not quite being trained properly, but once I learned everything it was awesome. I liked my coworkers, hell I even liked my manager most days. We all worked well as a team and everything, for the most part, ran smoothly. 

But then our manager quit , and they hired a new manager. Although she claims to have prior experience as a Dunkin manager, I swear to god she has no idea what she's doing. Everyone here welcomed her and tried to help her adjust to the store (our store had been renovated recently so we had a few machines that were different to what she was used to), and she was great.. for a few days.

 I had a week off for a vacation soon after she joined, and when I came back everything had gone to hell. I wish I was exaggerating when I say 75% of my coworkers had already quit, without even a 2 weeks notice. From what I heard over text, she wasn't listening to the hours people said they could work and was scheduling people when they weren't at all available, but then getting mad when they said they couldn't come in. A few times, she left a gap in the schedule where NO ONE WAS SCHEDULED TO BE IN THE STORE. The store, left completely unattended, for SEVERAL HOURS. Machines were breaking because she refused to learn how to use them properly. She'd come on the floor to ""help"", make a mess, and then leave and expect everyone else to clean it up. And in my experience since I've come back, it's all true. I've specifically said I cannot, under any circumstances, work opening shifts. Last week she scheduled me for exclusively opening. I texted her, AGAIN, to tell her I couldn't, and she told me I had to ""figure it out and find someone to cover."" I switched with a girl who said she couldn't do closing shifts and only got closing shifts. 

Now that we're constantly understaffed, we're all just trying our best and, yes, we're taking shortcuts. Shoot me, sometimes I'll make a latte right in the cup instead of putting it in the metal tin first. Or I'll bounce between stations instead of sticking to one because we don't have enough people to staff every station! And when I'm closing I have to leave my coworker out on the floor by herself to go to the back to do closing chores because we don't have anyone else to help. But she is constantly nitpicking everything and saying it's ""not standard!!"" but it's literally the only way we can get through the day anymore.

I came in yesterday, and said Hello to her on my way in. Without even saying hello or good morning or anything, the first thing she said to me, at 6 in the fucking morning, was ""Why did it take you more than 10 minutes to do boxes yesterday?"" It was truck day, I had literally an entire stores worth of supplies that we had unpacked from boxes, and ALL of those boxes had to be broken down. Anyone who works at Dunkin knows that is DOZENS of boxes, and most of them are too big to fit in the dumpster at all so they have to be cut and well broke down before they can be taken out. And that's not including the 2 minutes each way it takes to pull the trashcan to the dumpster, and you usually need at least 2-3 trips (if not more). And I told her all of this, and she said she didn't care, and that next time she caught me ""wasting time"" she'd suspend me.

DunkinDonuts,"This also applies to most other meal delivery services.


Baskin Robbins has a core set of flavors that we must keep at all times, and a rotating monthly array of the other ones determined by both Dunkin brands and the franchisee. This is also true for toppings, LTOs and niche items such as mangonadas. 


**Doordash does not recognize that the flavors change and will show all of them as available!**


As such, when the order comes in, we must wait for the driver to come by, let them know the missing items and hope that the customer answers their phone. If they can't answer the phone, the driver cancels and another is sent over and over until either the customer picks up their phone, we decide to substitute something similar and write a note, or the customer cancels on their end.


At least at my location, we cannot cancel orders on our end for Doordash. So please either call ahead to ask us what we have or be ready to answer the doordasher's call/text! It makes the situation much smoother and easier for all parties involved (plus you get your stuff faster!)

DunkinDonuts,"Been working at Dunkin for about 3 weeks now and I don't know if I should keep working here, they put us in this groupchat and the manager keeps complaining about things not being done all the time. She also doesn't want us to lock the doors at night, but the neighborhood the Dunkin is in is so sketchy. I see why my coworkers were locking it. I don't know how to make any of the drinks just refreshers and iced coffee. It feels like some of the people around me, especially the managers don't have patience with me. I close with one manager all the time and sometimes I ask him stuff, he doesn't respond. Like can he hear me or is he just ignoring me? Also when I first started working there, they told me they only had morning shift from 5am- 4pm and 1pm-9pm. I went with 1-9 because I take public transportation and wouldn't be able to get there on time. Fast-forward when I start working I see that one of my coworkers works from 9am-4pm. I confused and brought it up to the assistant manager who hired me, she reiterated that they only have those hours and I have to talk to the the store manager. Why should I have to talk to the store manager if shes the one I talk with about my hours ever since I was hired? Also she rejected my hours on the app after it being up there for a day, but she rejected the as soon as I said something about seeing my other coworkers schedule.

DunkinDonuts,"I just became a baker and I am curious what your normal night looks like. I started this last week and a brand new location. They had said my hours would be a specific time, roughly 7 hour shifts. 

So far I have been baking and frosting roughly 600-700 donuts, plus croissants, bagels, muffins, munchkins. By the time I just get everything glazed and and frosted I am usually at roughly 11 hours, and they also expect me to put all the baked goods in their respective places and then wash all the trays and sweep and mop the store. Which takes about another hour and a half or so. I just don‚Äôt see how any of this is remotely possible. They also said as time goes by they expect production to go up once people get used to the new location being there. I have been doing 12-13 hour shifts to finish things and I am absolutely miserable. 

Is it like this everywhere? Do other locations have multiple people baking? I know some locations get their donuts delivered so not every store bakes their own.

I worked there for over a year, and there are so many incidents of drunk + high coworkers, bullshit, equipment failing and falling apart and ridiculous amount of hours that were cut from everyone. I finally had enough one day when I was closing from 2:00 to 7:30 (30 hours a week), and my other coworker who only works till 7:00 had the audacity to not only hit on my mom (she was dropping off a car for me to drive back home), but give me a hard time and yelled at me for some stupid shit that I don't want to explain here. I had my two days off and finally had enough and put a 5 days notice because I was just not happy working there anymore. I know I would feel guilty if I hadn't put a notice in but I really wanted to ""give it to the man"" and just walk out, like so many people before.

I managed to save about $4,000 this summer before going to school and hopefully finding a job there instead. Dunkin taught me that it cannot be hard to run a business, something I want to do in the future. Just be kind, polite and don't put up with any bullshit and you will be successful.

DunkinDonuts,"As much as I love Dunkin, the app is just frustratingly bad for something that was created by one of the world's most successful coffee chains.

All the time, I open the app to find that my saved gift card and credit card info have just completely vanished. I'll go to check out and it'll say ""add payment method"" as if I didn't have anything saved. I restart the app and then they magically re-appear.  

Half the time, the app randomly decides to not let me check out---the ""place order"" button turns grey and won't let me do anything. I've found that the only way around this issue is to delete the order and completely re-select everything. 

And don't even get me started on the mess that is the points system. The ""deals"" they have often don't even work. My app currently has the ""mobile order an iced drink on Monday and get 100 points"" deal going on right now. So I ordered an iced latte on the app this Monday and the points never came through! This isn't the first time that this has happened!

I will say, however, the app sometimes messes up in a good way LMAO. For instance, after I redeemed my free birthday drink in-store a couple months ago, the reward never left my app. So the next day, I used it in a mobile order and got a second free drink haha. And then just today, I was using another free drink reward I had. The drink was all that I ordered---so I paid nothing, but my app is trying to say that I spent like $15 in that transaction and gave me 60 free points for it.

It was / is my favorite DD item and the best way to describe it is that it was a heavily glazed, dark croissant.  It was brown in color and long; not circular.  The best part about it was that it was so dense and flaky inside and the outer coating of this item could be peeled off to reveal the flaky dough inside.  It's definitely not a french crueller, cronut, glazed stick, original stick, or jelly stick.

DunkinDonuts,"Today at work was a nightmare. Got in at 8am, clock in, and go to beverage 1 where I'm assigned. Immediately I notice our AC is down. It's 95 degrees outside, we've only been open four hours but all of the donuts look melted and disgusting.


Then I go to make a drink and notice is that the sticker machine is printing the writing HUGE, so only the first few letters of each ingredient are being shown on the sticker. Ex. 1 cre, 2 fre, 4 su instead of 1 cream, 2 French vanilla, 4 sugars. And for frozens it would just say ""(size) frozen"" and we couldn't tell if it was a frozen coffee or frozen hot chocolate. So I had to keep looking on the screen to try and identify what I was making. 


After figuring out what the first drink was I went to put cream in it, only for the dispenser not to shoot anything out (despite at least half full.) I try to use the other machine, same issue. I manually open tiny creamer packets, pour them in, and tell my manager so she knows it's broken.


Next I fill a blender to make a frozen, and pass it off to beverage three for them to blend it. I hear them freaking out, look over, and the machine wouldn't stop dispensing ice. It was supposed to make a small coolata but it has completely filled the blender with ice and was still trying to dispense more. We had to shut down the machine and couldn't do frozens again for the rest of the day.


I got swapped to drivethrough later in the day, and noticed that our drivethrough window wasn't automatically shutting like it was supposed to. This would've been fine, seeing as there wasn't AC or anything so it's not like it could get any hotter, except it was rainy and the wind was blowing all the rain into the store. Had to keep manually pushing/pulling on the window to get it to close and open.


Not only was the rain getting in the store, but it was raining so hard that I was practically screaming into my headset and the people in the drivethrough couldn't hear me still! And then they'd get upset that I wasn't taking their order even though I was trying to, And I had to explain at the window that it was just because of the rain.


Then my manager made me take the trash + all the boxes out. In the rain. On truck day, where I had 5 trash cans worth of boxes + 2 trash cans of actual trash.

DunkinDonuts,"So my understanding is when an item (food/cup/lids/ect..) falls on the dirty floor you have to throw it out. Are there exceptions to this rule? Does rinsing in the sink make a single use item like cups or lids that have been on the floor usable? 

Personally I would not want a lid on my coffee that's been on the floor where melted ice water and peoples shoes are intermingled. Maybe I am not well versed in knowing weather rinsing floor juice off of things counts as sanitary.  So I am looking for opinions.. is it reasonable to rinse? Or should they be tossed?",If it hits the floor it's trash.. right?

DunkinDonuts,"Returned back to work today after my day off, came back to a nice surprise of the big redesign of the Dunkin app. 

According to the paper (which I forgot to snap a pic of!) all of the Southern California Dunkin‚Äôs are going to be the first Dunkin‚Äôs in the country to transition from DD Perks to Dunkin Rewards. The transition will happen later this month or next month. 

I saw a post posted yesterday or the day before talking about this change. If you want more information on the transition check out that post, however to summarize the change, more rewards than just a free drink like sandwiches, donuts and more! Only downside is the good drinks are all obtainable by acquiring 500+ points making it harder to get to the free drink reward.. 

The paper did not mention when the transition will happen for other Dunkin‚Äôs but I cannot imagine it will take long after. Dunkin has also shipped shirts for team members to promote the newly designed app.",It‚Äôs Official! DD Perks ‚Äî&gt; Dunkin Rewards!

DunkinDonuts,"I work at a Dunkin where we do things relatively informally, so I‚Äôm not clear on the rules in this area completely.

The first customer actually asked me and I told him no, so he gave me the extra dollar (he had the money to pay) but didn‚Äôt want the change so he gave me a penny he got from our tip jar and demanded a dollar anyway, despite me telling him it was our tips and he could not have it. My boss was sitting right behind me so I didn‚Äôt make a fuss, but it really bothered me. I probably would‚Äôve just given him the full dollar in change(not 99¬¢) if my boss wasn‚Äôt right there and if he was actually nice.

I don‚Äôt want to make a fuss over a penny but I don‚Äôt want people to keep thinking it‚Äôs ok and keep taking more.

DunkinDonuts,"My mother can be a bit much sometimes, honestly I don‚Äôt even know why she bothered to order just a black coffee, but we don‚Äôt have a coffee maker right now so I can‚Äôt shame her on that too much. She likes to claim allergies because she read the ‚ÄúHow to Karen‚Äù handbook that says apparently claiming allergies will get it absolutely removed, but even still‚Ä¶. I guess I should start at the beginning.

We went to Dunkin today because I wanted a coffee since I‚Äôve been up since 5am due to a new medication schedule that ain‚Äôt working for me. We go in because the line in the drive through was a bit long. I ordered my usual(butter pecan with oat milk iced latte), my stepfathers cappuccino blast because ours is the fancy Baskin Robins conjoined twin, and my mother wants a ‚ÄúBlack coffee ice blended thingy‚Äù Me trying to translate ‚ÄúJust a blended black coffee‚Äù, she asks for no dairy or sugar of any kind because she is on a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù(and thinks she‚Äôs better than us for it), now I don‚Äôt care about her ordering it without dairy or sugar or anything because if she wants to drink her bitter burnt coffee beans I‚Äôm not going to stop her.
I redeem my free beverage for my drink because why not. We are waiting for our drinks, mine and my stepfathers are finished first, and now we‚Äôre waiting on my mothers. The girl comes over and asks if my mother wants whipped cream, I understand why, some people ask for no dairy or dairy alternatives but still get whipped cream but my mother gets the Karen hair up her ass and freaks out ‚ÄúI said no cream! I only wanted a frozen blended black coffee!‚Äù Despite the fact she knows that I get panic attacks over any person getting outrageously upset, I manage to hold together despite wanting to gag my mother with the dish towel.
Well, for some reason the girl becomes very upset over this and cops an attitude. Like I can understand my mothers attitude not being the best, not by a very far margin, but the girl began acting like my mother had held her down and called her names.
‚ÄúWell you ordered a cappuccino blast.‚Äù The girl first goes ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my husbands yes, I am ALLERGIC to dairy!!‚Äù (Honestly not sure if she‚Äôs allergic or lactose intolerant like me, she claims she had some joint pain and felt swollen and bloated the last time she had some dairy). I explain my mother just wanted a black coffee blended up with ice, while my mother is freaking out and going ‚ÄúI just wanted a black coffee with ice!‚Äù(Leaving off the blended part entirely which probably is what spurs this next part), while one girl is going ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fix this for you ma‚Äôam.‚Äù The girl comes over and SLAMS down a cup of just black ice coffee in front of my mother and walks off. While another girl is explaining that if my mother wanted it blended, it had to be done with dairy or cream in it which honestly doesn‚Äôt even sound right to me, but I don‚Äôt work there so whatever. As we are leaving the girl calls ‚ÄúHave a good day ma‚Äôam!‚Äù After my mother as I am trying to herd her out the door.

I am not condoning my mothers attitude, not by a minute, but I do not think this girls attitude was the best either by any mile. I am left wondering if I should even bother complaining?",Should I complain?

DunkinDonuts,"To put it shortly, I was working for a few days during training time, then was put on a 2 day schedule to work 6 hours, then later given 1 day a week of work for 5 to 12, with some days being 6 to 12 and 7 to 12. Then this past month, my boss called and transferred me over to another Dunkin but gave me more hours to work. I worked four days from 5 to 12 under a new manager. But after one week with that crew, the manager realized that she had too many people working on the same shift and needed to send some back. So, she sent me back but didn't tell me even though she said she would give me an update Friday. I found out Sunday of by the district manager that I was sent back and I would get a call from my old manager about the days they will want me to work. 

I got no calls that whole week. I left a message the following Monday and got an answer back on Tuesday that they're putting me on Mondays but are trying to decide what time. I didn't hear anything else the whole week until today that I'm getting Mondays but working only four hours. I might come in this coming Monday but the scheduling has made me consider quitting, maybe after working that Monday. Because it feels like a waste of time. They might be oversaturated with workers since it's the summer and this is popular place to get a summer job, and I don't want to deal with high-stress for that low a pay. Not again.

I don't know if this is the right move yet because, while I'm not desperate, and I just mostly wanted answers when I called last week to see what was going on, I don't know if it would be the best move to abruptly quit after being given some work hours. I'm of course searching and applying to other jobs but I haven't heard back from any HR reps yet. I also have another job but need extra money to pay off some bills and Dunkin pays quicker since it pays weekly. What should I do?",So my hours were reduced to 4 hours on one day a week. Might quit.

I wonder if other people have the same experience because I have a theory. I use the sweet n low packets at home and I find that when I tear off the top I don‚Äôt always tear into the pocket of sweetener. The packet seems to be sealed around the edges much wider than you would think so I wonder if sometimes they‚Äôre tearing off the top, pouring in nothing, and tossing a packet full of sweetener.

DunkinDonuts,"hey, y'all..

this is my first time posting on this subreddit.

anyway, I started working at my very close Dunkins for the past month and a few weeks, and it has been alright. I do overnights and it's just Drive-Thru only until the front doors are unlocked. The plus side is the pay rate and my awesome co-worker. But once 4 AM rolls around, these three guys punch in and are there for the early morning shift. One is a baker, the other is always at sandwich station as the other is there to just open the front doors for Eat In and does the necessary morning shift stuff like temperature records, etc. 

So, I've noticed it is just me (a female) working overnight with my co-worker who's a dude. majority of this Dunks are all men besides my manager and two-morning shift workers. We are always together doing the work and I refuse to leave my ""space"" on the drive-thru area because these early morning shift guys (the 4 AM crew) give me an uncomfortable vibe and I hate the way each of them stares at me when I'm just trying to do my job and I have caught each of them staring at me in a weird way especially when I'm bending over to reach something from the ground level. Almost three weeks ago, the guy who is responsible for being on the front counter and opening up, said to me ""maybe I can help you get better sleep"" with a wink after I complained that I will be tired when I get home and even if I try to sleep, I have two kids under the age of 6 who need my care. When he said that, I felt disgusted and gave him a glare and told him that wasn't cool which he laughed off. Then a week ago and this week, he purposely tried bumping into me so he can feel my ass while I'm making coffee orders in the drive-thru (he's a big average guy but c'mon, there's still space between us but he makes it seem like its cramped). My co-worker has been observant of this behavior ad has told both my manager and me about it and he hates it because all I'm trying to do is my job and I'm already in a committed relationship with kids. My manager has reported these guys and they each have a history of making other (ex) female employees uncomfortable that they either transferred out of the store or quit. My manager has also spoken to this guy but he's back at it with his lewd comments and giving me that off creep vibes. Yesterday after leaving, my co-worker stayed behind to count his register and he heard these guys (including the cleaner and other male crew members) talking about how ""f\*\*\*able"" I look, how my ass looks, etc) and my co-worker snapped at them by \*again\* telling them that I'm 27 and happily taken, and to stop talking about me like that. 

They all laughed at him and kept on with their conversation.

I'm disgusted, repulsed, and don't feel comfortable showing up to work in this kind of environment and I'm sure anyone else will agree. I have vented to my husband about these issues and it has made him very pissed off that before I was ready to clock out this past Sunday, he came to pick me up but went straight to the front counter to ask for my manager and she was there and can see how pissed he was and is aware of the situation that she asked him to follow her to her office and talk to him about this and showed him her reports she has made against these guys. All my manager can say is that if I want, I can call HR/Corporate directly and just make a complaint or threaten them with a harassment lawsuit because she has made numerous complaints and all these guys get is a ""slap on the wrist"" and my manager's boss has already made it clear that they don't want to fire anyone because the Dunks I work at is very short-staffed already..

Idk guys, please share your opinions about this or message me privately. I'm to the point of just quitting or relocating but this store is the closest to my apartment and if I chose to be transferred, I know I'm gonna need to travel and don't have a car at this moment.",sexual harassment at the Dunks I work at..

DunkinDonuts,"I have to share this with someone because this one customer we always get is.. interesting to say the least.

Apparently she's a regular, but because of my schedule I've never seen her before. However, my availability changed so Ive been working earlier hours, meaning I've started to encounter her.

My first time meeting her was today when I was working drive through. It wasn't super busy and she walked up (yes, walked) to our drivethrough speaker asking for a free water. I said okay, because it's just water and it was a super hot day, and called out to my coworker asking for a medium water. (My stores policy is that we can give away mediums or smalls for free, but larges have to be paid for.) She walks up to the window and I told her like Hey, it's really dangerous to be walking in a drivethrough and could you please just come inside? Our lobby was open, and I was kinda worried a car would pull through and wouldn't see her (our drivethrough has a weird blind spot, which she was standing right in the middle of). She said no and that she needed her water, so I went to go get it quickly before she got hurt. I brought it out to her and told her to have a good day, before walking away from the window to go do something else.

A few seconds later I hear pounding on our drivethrough window. I go back over and she's slamming her fists on the glass, screaming that she wanted a large. I apologized, told her I wasn't allowed to give away larges for free. She reached in my window to dump the medium onto the floor and said ""No, a large."" I went to get my supervisor and hep was just like ""Oh, yeah it's her, just give it to her."" I was just in shock. Gave her a large and she went from hysterical to happy in seconds. Walked back up the drivethrough (towards the speaker, not the exit??) giggling and drinking her water. She yelled ""THANK YOU!"" at the speaker and walked away.

I still don't know how to feel about it to be honest. Everyone else at work has seemingly just accepted it but I'm just like.. why do we let her get away with this? I feel like at the very least someone should call someone for her cause I feel like with the way she's acting she needs help, genuinely.",Crazy Customer

((i.e. extra swirl, whipped cream, ‚Äúcan i add a tomato pesto &amp; 3 hash browns?‚Äù, hot not iced and vice versa)) be responsible. know what you‚Äôre ordering, be ready to pay when you add last minute things. they still cost the same &amp; it‚Äôs not fair to the people behind you who have also been waiting 10m b/c people keep either changing their minds of their order or attempting to add more to their order while at the window. be conscious &amp; be kind. coming up to the window with an attitude after YOU forgot something isn‚Äôt okay either. the people who serve you are just that people. don‚Äôt be surprised when you won‚Äôt be served b/c you‚Äôre rude are acting a hot mess. i always can help, i actually love helping people out, but not with that attitude !",human decency is free btw

DunkinDonuts,"I really like Dunkin grilled cheese sandwiches; but, the issue is they are usually toasted only on one side. Because I order from many different Dunkin locations, I‚Äôm assuming this is the official cooking procedure (I‚Äôm guessing to meet order time quotas, or some other corporate agenda‚Ä¶ because otherwise, a single-sided grilled cheese sandwich is not fathomable). 

I tried to ask in the drive through to cook both sides, and the girl said ‚Äúokay, so you want it ‚Äòextra toasty‚Äô‚Äù. I thought that was Dunkin lingo, so I started ordering them that way, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have a grilled cheese sandwich, extra toasty‚Äù (I felt foolish saying it every time).  The results were hit or miss; so, I figured ‚Äúextra toasty‚Äù isn‚Äôt actually a Dunkin term‚Ä¶ the girl just said that.

So, I went back requesting them to ‚Äútoast the sandwich on both sides, please‚Äù.  It‚Äôs still a roll of the dice. Sometimes it‚Äôs perfect, sometimes it‚Äôs double-toasted on the same damn side and not toasted on the other side, and once they just assembled it and gave it to me untoasted.

DunkinDonuts,"Let me start a list of some of the most weird shit / dumbest shit customers say:

\- they order 'well done hash browns' as if it's a steak or something. I actually laughed when someone ordered and asked them what they meant, dude says, just put the hash browns in the oven for 2 rotations. I highly doubt that's what he really wanted.  

\- ""let me get a small black iced coffee with 2 shots of x, 2 sugar, and some caramel"" 

\- I had a guy order a black hot coffee with 3 creams, NO SUGAR. gave it to him, he complained it had 3 creams. Same guy proceeds to order again, 2 frozen medium coffees. Give him the first one, buddy loses it and screams that he wanted a small. I told him ok i'll give him a small even though he paid for mediums. 

\- I had someone order 3 sandwhiches, then goes to wait, next person ordered a small coffee and a glaze stick. I give him it. First customer comes over and starts getting in my face about someone else getting served first. I said he didn't order hot food, the customer goes ""well he has the same bag"", I was actually dumbfounded at how stupid you gotta be to say that and think that that is how things work.

\- People really think as I'm making someone's coffee they can order by yelling at me their order. I usually just ignore these tards.

\- People that wait in line and come up to you and go ""i ordered on the app"", like okay.

\- People that come in complain we don't have their mobile order and then I look at their app and tell them they ordered to a different dunkins. Very satisfying especially when they're all worked up over 'our' error. 

\- had a guy scream at me for a blueberry donut, I said I'm too new here to understand where they might be and he points to the cornbread donuts and asks for that one. Not sure if he was happy with the result.

\- Had another guy scream at me after I asked him to confirm he wanted 2 coconut donuts.

\- Had a crazy ass lady that spent her whole day sitting in the dunks ask for the dragonfruit refresher in a cup and ask if it would be free. Like, what.

\- Have multiple idiots that think the tip jar is a 'take a penny' type deal. It's not.

\- People who don't move out of the way after they order when there is a line.

\- Had a dude scream at me ""WHEN AM I GONNA GET MY COFFEE I BEEN WAITIN HERE FOR 5 MINUTES"" during a rush. we are 2 people working, ive been there at that point a week probably.

\- Had another dude get his croissant wrong it was chocolate not plain and he lost his mind and walked out yelling FUCK THIS instead of waiting for a plain one to be heated, literally does not take even a minute. 

\- People that are rude / yell at you then come back in and pretend it never happened, naw ur service is gonna be slow as hell and I'm going to be rude back to you. 

\- some of these peoples coffee orders are legitimately disgusting and sometimes half the cup is full of flavoring shit, like u see the posts on here all the time about nasty coffee orders, it's true and a good chunk of the time it's ordered on ubereats/grubhub/doordash.

I am absoluetely devastated over this. I'm 33 and have been ordering this drink since I was a teenager. It was definitely a comfort drink I got for special occasions or whenever I was traveling since I'm not an every day Dunks person. I don't drink coffee and only make tea at home because buying it at Dunks is silly to me, so this drink just made me so happy. A way to my heart. 

&amp;#x200B;

The chai latte and vanilla chai laette is shit in comparison. I've managed to find one place locally and one in New Hampshire that still has the powder left over and made me one. I tried buying the powder yesterday in NH and they wouldn't let me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone tell me how it's made? I'm friends with a mobile coffee shop owner who says she makes a similar drink and I would love to try and get it replicated. I cannot remember what kind of milk it's made with though? Also, and this seems like a dumb question, but is it black tea or chai tea? Recipes I've found online in the past have said black tea.

DunkinDonuts,"here are some things i‚Äôve noticed that bug workers and customers alike 

1) if you are ordering a dozen donuts and you want to pick them out dear god do NOT do it through the drive thru. come in. also donuts typically sell out by 1pm so if you come at 5 and ask for a dozen you will probably be let down.

2) if you want cream or sugar please say that. if you want a specific amount, tell the person. so many times people assume the employees just know their order and know how they take their coffee and then get mad when it doesn‚Äôt come out the way they wanted. also- we don‚Äôt mind re making drinks at all.

3) if you say you want a medium black coffee with caramel in it- then it‚Äôs no longer a black coffee because the swirls have milk built in. 

4) if you place your mobile order a minute before you come it won‚Äôt be ready. and if you place it and come thru an hour later everything will be melted. my best advice is to place it before leaving your house so it will be ready when you come.

5) if you have two separate orders please tell the person at the window instead of just starting at them and not leaving the drive thru. sometimes it‚Äôs so busy the order taker doesn‚Äôt have time to notify the cashier that someone has two separate orders and people will just sit in their cars looking into space for 5 minutes instead of telling you they had a second order. 

6) if you pay in all change i will personally take 10 minutes to count it and hand your food out, i get if it was a $2 bill but if you give me $8 worth of dimes and nickels and are rude about it (most times) then i will take my sweet old time doing it. 

7) MOST IMPORTANT- we are just people like you we are just doing our jobs and it‚Äôs just coffee. if it is wrong, ask nicely and it will be remade. so many people treat food workers as personal servants and get mad when they aren‚Äôt catered to during a rush where everyone is doing 5 things at once. be patient and nice and appreciate that it‚Äôs just coffee and mess ups can be fixed :) i can tell you that the regular customers we are rude are very well known and all the employees know who is rude and who isn‚Äôt before they even come up to the window. and the regular customers who are sweet bulls relationships and we are happy to see them!",tips for customers

DunkinDonuts,"Share your worst dunkin experiences either as a worker or customer. I‚Äôll go first! 

I went to dunks last week and had the worst experience. I have never complained but I wish I had in this case. 
Pulled into the drive thru, dunks was empty. Sat at the mic for 12 minutes until someone finally spoke up. Teens were laughing and goofing off, but I really just needed a coffee so I stayed. Ordered a small black iced coffee with sugar and avocado toast. 
Pulled to the window and couldn‚Äôt see anyone in there. Sat around for 10 minutes before I almost left and finally a woman came by. She looked cooked out of her mind and asked me again what I had ordered. I repeated my order twice to her and she repeated it back to me and charged me. She then handed me a medium hot coffee with XX, and I swear someone had already drank from it because there was pink lipgloss on the cap‚Ä¶ 
Annoyed I just explained my order again and she apologized. 
I see her goofing off with some guy through the window, and I waited for another 10 minutes. I got so annoyed I knocked on the window. Pissed this time I just kindly asked for my coffee and food. She then handed me a wet bag and a small iced coffee with some type of swirl in it. I wound up leaving rather then complaining. 
Got home and the avocado toast wasn‚Äôt out in the regular box, it was wrapped in a napkin, soggy wet, with brown avocado spread‚Ä¶ 
I wish I had the courage to complain, but honestly the employees gave me such an off putting vibe I didn‚Äôt want to put up with them. I‚Äôm debating writing in anonymously to the manager because now that I have shared my experiences my siblings and friends also had bad experiences with those two as well. My dad even pointed out that the guy doesn‚Äôt even work there, or just is never in uniform. And the woman often had her kids back there with her.

2) cold brew with brown sugar cold foam: this drink is only cold brew with foam on top and no syrup by default.

DunkinDonuts,"The Dunkin app is telling me that a large iced oatmilk latte plain before flavors would be 180 calories. This can‚Äôt be right.

DunkinDonuts,"Hey guys!

I had a really weird experience happen today and wanted to share with you guys. Today I got a cookies and cream milkshake, and the workers took a really long time. I did not mind as I wasn‚Äôt in a hurry, and there were no other cars Infront of me or behind me. When I received my drink, it was very watery and not at all like the previous milkshakes I have had. I did not want to be a ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù so I drove off and took a sip, but it had no flavor and was definitely not like any of the previous milkshakes I have had. Due to this, I decided to turn around and take it back to the store to ask if he could maybe remake it. I was really nice and asked him if he could remake it, and the worker replied with ‚Äúthe drink is perfectly fine, if I remake it it‚Äôs just going to be the same way, so idk what to tell you.‚Äù I was perplexed, I have never received a response like this at any establishment, so I just asked for a refund. The worker then said I don‚Äôt know how to do refunds so just come back another day. 

This was such an odd experience, and the Dunkin Donuts I went to has had some recent problems, with many of my friends complaining that since they switch employees so often, the employees are new and sometimes mess up the drinks. This is totally fine, and was my initial expectation, that maybe he was a new employee. But saying that you will not remake the drink because you made it right is such an odd way to reply to such a request. I wanted to share in this sub because I love Dunkin and this has never happened before, and to be honest made me quite sad.",Employees being rude to customers

Recently I have contacted the Starbucks workers union asking for help unionizing Dunkin.

I‚Äôve been trying to unionize at my store, but if we create a union ourselves it‚Äôs a lot harder. So I reached out to the most similar local union I could find: the Starbucks workers united union.

As of yesterday, they responded. I plan on talking to someone from there and we can take it from there. But finally, the first steps of unionizing are underway!!!!

I ask because I've noticed if I order ""1 cane syrup,"" it always is sweeter than when I order 2. I believe the app represents 1 shot by removing the quantity altogether, which I suspect most employees read as ""they want the normal amount of cane syrup,"" which is 3 shots.

DunkinDonuts,"Ok, so after reading [this thread's comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/tl5qp4/lovely_customer_mailed_us_a_complaint/) I am so curious about how Dunkin training works...because \[to me\] the quality of drinks varies so much. Is it true that most Dunkin workers just freestyle / disregard the recipe cards? It seems like there's no set ratio / that it is akin to a local restaurant where there's no concrete standards. A quick google search shows I'm not the only one who thinks Dunkin can be inconsistent.

I'm interested in how they train u guys cuz at Starbys they're so strict on amounts. Like we have to fill ingredients up to certain lines on the cup, shake drinks a certain amount of times. For our brown sugar oatmilk shaken espresso we have to shake the cinnamon bottle twice. For lattes/cappuccinos we have to steam the milk for a certain amount of time. We even have set patterns for how we have to drizzle caramel on the sides of cups + on top of drinks.

It‚Äôs never just donuts either, there‚Äôs always sandwiches and drinks and it would be so much easier to come in and actually see what donuts we have instead of just guessing.

DunkinDonuts,"So I just found out my dunkin sells their swirl which is great because I can just make the coffee at home and it should taste the same. I do three pumps but I just cannot get the swirl to dissolve that well, i‚Äôll stir with a spoon and shake the coffee. Then I take a sip out of a straw and basically get the entire swirl shot that‚Äôs still at the bottom. How does dunkin usually do it, do they just shake the cup or am I doing something wrong.


Also for a side note, I make iced coffee with almond milk. I don‚Äôt know how much almond milk usually goes with the medium iced coffee but i usually put maybe 3-4 ounces? I don‚Äôt know if that would have an effect if I‚Äôm putting too much or too little milk in",Swirl not dissolving

Of course, the first time I‚Äôm getting Dunkin with a fairly new friend, I confidently order a medium frozen Dunkacinno, and neither my friend nor the cashier have any idea what I‚Äôm talking about.

DunkinDonuts,"My go-to drink is a large iced macchiato. I notice the ice is literally almost to the top of the cup- maybe about a half inch to an inch under it. I see there are lines on the side of the cup marked ""1"" and ""2"" WAY further down- are those lines supposed to be used for ice?

It just feels like I'm paying over $6 for mostly ice. I know there's an option for ""less ice"" if you order ahead but I've been afraid for a macchiato either they won't fill the cup then, or it will throw off the ratio of milk/espresso. Any insight if it's supposed to be made with that much ice or not? Should I be trying that ""less ice"" option? I also count calories and don't want to throw it way off if I end up requesting less ice and just getting more milk- but then I wonder if the little liquid I'm actually getting in the drink is *really* 380 calories if the cup is mostly ice.",How much ice is there supposed to be?

DunkinDonuts,"Hiya. 
Some info- I live in a small town in New England. Dunkins quite popular. Husband works at various job sites and frequents a dunkin location 2-3 times a week, goes to other locations the other days. 
I place his mobile orders for him through the app every time he needs it which is often. 
I am placing these orders 10-15 minutes before he arrives at the locations. Why? Because the food part of the order is only ready half of the time. So we figure give them lots of extra time to have it done. But it happened again this morning. I placed the order at 6:45AM, husband walked in at 7AM. Drink is ready, food isnt. 
Weve never been offered refunds, never even really complained to the workers because we arent the confrontational kind. At this point Im just irritated for my husband. He doesnt have time to get in line and wait after finding out his food isnt ready for 10 mins. Hence why we use mobile ordering in the first place. So he can walk in, get his stuff, walk out. For months they just...never gave him the donuts he ordered. Now its whatever food he gets. The drinks the only thing present. 
I wish I had a record of how often this happens. It sounds ridiculous but we've been doing this for over a year, and i want to say at least 30-40% of the time he walks out without breakfast and is upset, to say the least. 
I called customer support this morning.. Guy says he will bring this up to the specific stores owners/managers and have them call me. Not looking forward to that as its a small town where everybody knows everybody.. This has the potential to get uncomfortable. But we are pretty fed up after so many repeats of this.","Mobile Orders only ever half ready, really irked."

DunkinDonuts,I was just thinking about this when I was making food. We use black trays that are reusable so when we make bacon the fat spills over the sheet we use to cook on.

The owner is teaching me but she is very pedantic and always stresses me for time even though I just started. I also have to remember all the things as a baker and upfront which I didn't sign up for, and thought I would have no customer interaction. I asked if we could start earlier but she said no because the goods wouldn't be fresh by opening. I also asked if there were any other hours I could work, but also said no. My coworkers said overnight is the least desired role due to the excessive nature of the position and the particular nature of the owner. I am also a bad multitasker so the myriad tasks I have to get done in 3 hours is sort of overwhelming for me. I tried to stick it out for 3 weeks, but it doesn't feel like it's getting any better. Are all of the overnight positions like this at other Dunkin's? I would like to know others thoughts and if I should suck it up.","Just became an Overnight Baker, did I get tricked?"
DunkinDonuts,,Dunkin Donuts Magnets üß≤ at the shop come show what America runs in!!!
DunkinDonuts,"Okay, so this has been bugging me for the past few hours ever since I ended my shift today at work. So, I work at the local Dunkin's in my town and the day was mostly good. One of my better workdays even. I'm new and have only been there for a month and a half by now. Today, during one of the last hours of my shift, I was trying to fix the donut case. It was almost noon and there were two empty spaces at the top that I wanted to fill with two single trays of donuts that were at the bottom so I could cover the last shelf with the blinds once it was empty. 

This girl who I just met last week starts coming over while I am thinking about putting them next to the big trays of donuts and is like ""You probably can just leave the space empty because I'm going to move the muffins over there."" Now the muffins are perfectly placed at the top and usually sitting there in the other case because they're supposed to be. Not to mention there is a full single tray of each muffin next to each other. The second case was looking nice. There were cases with single donuts, and I would gladly move them to a different tray that has space, but sometimes the manager tells me to leave them in their own tray, so we don't confuse the customers. Plus there were plenty of donuts in other trays, and spaces between the trays at the top that needed to be filled and they would perfectly be there, if I just placed some in the middle at the top and fill any empty spaces with some donut trays at the bottom, like my supervisor usually tells me to do. 

I don't know if this girl is returning employee or new, she might have been the former, but I was a little confused when she told me that she was going to transfer the muffins there. I mean, I've seen other co-workers just do what I was initially going to do. When I told her what I was about to do, she was like ""I'm just telling you this because I'm closing and am going to put the muffins over on this case instead"". I told her I was just putting some on there for now so there wouldn't be empty gaps because I know our boss doesn't like that, and I placed a tray of Boston Kreme at the top to fill a gap. She just said ""Okay, you can do that for now,"" but then I saw her walk over to two of our other co-workers who were just standing there by drive-thru looking at us, and she looks like she was saying something to them, and then the other co-worker she was talking to said ""Yeah, that's how everyone else feels,"" while she was looking right at me. And I was like ""Are they talking about me?"" 

Like, what does ""everyone \[supposedly\] feel""? Because I wasn't trying to be a jerk or know-it-all. I know I'm new I was just trying to follow what I was usually told, especially since I had tried to put different pastries on certain trays and told to ""keep some in their own trays instead and focus on filling the gaps"". Plus, I still had chores to finish before my shift ends and fixing the donut case is one of them, so I didn't want to just stand there and do nothing. I immediately asked  the other two co-workers if I had made a mistake and explained what I was trying to do. They told me  that they might move stuff over soon, so I was like ""Okay"". 

I then told the girl that I'm just ""leaving some trays up there to fill in the gaps for now"" because I didn't want to leave the case looking incomplete like that. Then she was like ""Okay, it's just that I have a certain way of doing things when organizing the cases."" And I was like ""Okay, I understand."" I was like, 'alright, I'll leave it to her. She probably is just a returning employee and have done this many times already. It's whatever. My only issue is that fact that it seems like she was talking about me or what I was doing to the other co-workers and one of them was making a passive-aggressive comment while looking in my direction. I didn't know exactly what the girl whispered to her, but with what she did immediately after what I said I was trying to do, it seems like this is what happened. 

You could easily guess what the subject of their mini-chat was about at that point. And I'm thinking ""Okay. I'm not trying to step on anyone's toes. I'm just trying to do my job. If this girl has something to say, she can say it to my face instead of being a fake b\*tch and trying to say something behind my back as if I wouldn't notice. As for the other co-worker, she's said some mild condescending shit before (did on my second day of work, if you remember my post about that), but she's usually upfront with me on some stuff if I've made a mistake. I don't need that passive-aggressive nonsense just because I wanted to just fill the remaining gaps on a donut case. You know? Like, I don't have time for that toxic BS. It's rude and petty. Like, if I was making a mistake here by not letting her do it before my shift ends or something, my bad, but it does not warrant that behavior. Not to mention the fact that they seemed a bit standoffish when I was clocking out for work annoyed me, too. Like, it's not that deep. Have any of you ever dealt with something like this months within your start at Dunkin' Donuts?",I'm wondering if my co-workers were talking shit because of something small I did at work.

I have heard say that the reason it lasted only so long was because it wasn't aimed at plant based people. It was one of those ""veg* products mainly aimed at health conscious omnivore"".

DunkinDonuts,"I'm a Dunkin employee and I love being able to make people mornings/day great!! what I don't like is our tap system. we have a fancy 8 tap system that I loved at first but there's one spout the iced tea spout that smells like sewer water. I've cleaned what I can ,I've heard that the line has been replaced and mantinice has been out to fix it. My co workers tell me I'm obsessed but ... Guys this tea from the tap smells rancid!! Buts it's only when it comes out of the tap when it's in the shuttle it's fine.

I order through the app, is this possible that they are seeing and reading the ticket wrong so consistently? Or am I just going insane.

They need to wait until someone is courteous enough to let them go ahead of them.

DunkinDonuts,[removed],Working at Dunkin
DunkinDonuts,"for back ground: i‚Äôm 18, and recently, about 4 months ago started a job with Dunkin (side note: HIGHLY do NOT recommend) i‚Äôve seen my co-workers deal with karen‚Äôs but i‚Äôve never dealt with one. 

I got to work at around 3:25PM after having a panic attack over missing part of my uniform and overall having a bad day AND being late. I clock in, put my stuff away and go to the front. 

there‚Äôs a lady standing at the donut racks looking irritated, she looked at me and and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll are you going to help me?‚Äù and i politely said ‚Äúsure if you come over to the cash register i can get your order started‚Äù 

she comes over and starts her order, 18 munchkins and 2 custard filled donuts. After confirming with my co worker, i tell her we don‚Äôt have any more. She IMMEDIATELY cops an attitude, saying how ridiculous it is we don‚Äôt have donuts. I just kind of sit there until she decided on a new donut, she wanted Bismarck, again, we‚Äôre out of that. At that point she throws her hands down and says ‚Äúfine i don‚Äôt want any of it. i want a refund.‚Äù so i put the munchkins and donuts away. 

i‚Äôve never done a refund before, ever, so i try to ask one of the older girls, who tells me to text the manager. I text the manger who, is no help. So i figure it out myself after sitting there for 20 mins trying to figure it out, about half way through she asked to speak to a manager and my manager wasn‚Äôt there and she responded with ‚Äúso they‚Äôre having people who are useless and worthless at their job working with out a manager? wow‚Äù at this point im trying not to cry, im shaking violently, i haven‚Äôt eaten or drank at all at this point, im tired and not having a good day. 

I sit there and i don‚Äôt say anything and i figure it out and accidentally refunded for 14 munchkins and the two donuts instead of 18 munchkins so literally $1.05 was missing. She, once again, called me useless at my job and she wanted the managers number who was ignoring me now. She was yelling at me and i genuinely thought it was the system because i double checked and thought everything was okay, luckily at this point my managers boss came in and helped her, the lady switched her attitude with her and wasn‚Äôt rude at all while i was sitting there trying not to break down sobbing in the middle of the lobby. 

Once my managers boss left i immediately went to the freezer and sobbed for a good 5 minutes. Luckily i had awesome customers the rest of the day :) 

TL;DR: my first customer of the day after already having a bad day was a Karen who called me useless and worthless multiple times and yelled at me for a $1.05 mistake",got called useless and worthless by a karen today. i‚Äôm a teen.
DunkinDonuts,"Idk if anyone will remember but I quit dunkin and made a post when it happened and well... The combination of people not hiring me for 4 months and needing money desperately had me asking for my job back. Honestly, nothing changed-- besides the employees i once worked with quitting as well. But this also meant there were the SAME annoying customers, the SAME exhaustion of only getting 9.75 an hour and the SAME dread at the end of the day that I had to wake up early in the morning for a company that doesn't give a shit about it's employees.
Fortunately, When the chance presented itself, I asked for a reference from a coworker to get me in touch with Starbucks. Now, they may not be any different but at least I get actual fucking benefits and will be getting paid $12 an hour (and a pay raise of $15 the end of Summer.) I put my two weeks in once I got the offer and I'm not looking back. I finally got my actual dream job and I can't be any happier. To Dunkin', if you want higher employee retention rates, maybe make your benefits more than just One Free Sandwich each shift.",I'm leaving Dunkin'.... again.

I hate seeing articles like this because it really just shows that people don't understand how menus work. You can get any flavor in a coffee. A caramel cold brew is not a different menu item from a normal cold brew. That's why they separate the flavors from the drinks on the menu.

What makes it even worse is stuff like the final entry ""caramel cold foam cold brew,"" where they say they don't know if it's the same caramel that goes in the foam as that which goes in the drink. Like, no, the foam comes from a can and the caramel swirl is a syrup.

Dunkin' to me prides itself on simplicity that allows you to customize your drink how you want without being pretentious with their menu. So it annoys me when articles and people tackle it with the same mentality as they do Starbucks.",Article Dumbness

As for the Cornbread donut, I couldn't finish it. It was the consistency of the sour cream donut (which is what I usually get) with gritty corn meal. It also had a preservative-y fake sugar taste. Very weird mouth feel. I will not get that again.

The label then comes out also reflecting the ‚Äú1 caramel swirl‚Äù or whatever it is. 

However, when I mobile order, the label does not come out with the ‚Äú1‚Äù but rather it just says ‚Äú____ swirl‚Äù without any numbers in front. My question: as an employee, when you see this order come up for a mobile, do you know to only put one swirl?? Sometimes it tastes like there‚Äôs way more than just one. I‚Äôd love to know!!

DunkinDonuts,"Oh boy what an absolute shit show this was. I went to the dunkin closest to my gym after a workout. And this location is always hit or miss so I should have known better.

I ordered a ""medium iced cake batter latte with whole milk""

They gave me a medium iced *coffee* (cake batter) with oat milk. Okay no problem, people make mistakes. Another barista remade it.

Except this time she put a large iced cake batter signature latte on the counter. I asked whose it was. I thought maybe someone else ordered a cake batter signature latte *because I sure as hell didn't*. The barista said, ""this is what you ordered"". I said no I didn't. 

She upgraded me to a large signature because of their earlier mistake, which is my guess. Which is fine. But I don't want a 700-million calorie bomb with the whipped cream nasty mocha drizzle sprinkle bullshit on top. Ugh. I just wanted a basic bitch iced latte with 3 cake batter swirls. Why is that so hard? 

Anyway, I didn't ask them to remake it, said thank you and walked away. I think if you're going to upgrade someone's drink, ask them first: ""Would you like me to upgrade your drink to a large signature as a courtesy?"" 

Taste test: initial sip I get a massive sugar alcohol taste. It reminds me of old-school starbucks french vanilla Frappuccino's. I honestly don't taste cake batter. Just tastes like heavy french vanilla+alcohol. It's not the worst swirl I've tried. But I can't say that I am a fan. I definitely prefer the butter pecan now that I've tried both. With butter pecan I can still taste the espresso. Whereas with this one I don't taste coffee at all. It just tastes like sugar alcohol. So yeah, looks like this is a dud for me and I probably won't buy it again. #BringBackSaltedCaramel",My review of the cake batter signature latte

DunkinDonuts,"This is based off how my stores machines operate. 

For 2% milk and skim, request specifically 3-5 milk. Specify a number. If you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôll just say ‚Äúmilk‚Äù and most employees will use the lowest setting unless a number is specified. These milks (and cream) get dispensed from a machine. 

For dairy, almond, or coconut - at my store we literally eye these unless it‚Äôs a latte or macchiato. I would ask for the cup 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 filled with milk. Pls don‚Äôt take too much advantage of this and try to shortcut a latte. Lattes are made with espresso so it will NOT be the same no matter how much milk you put in. 

If you‚Äôre dining in, ask the front counter person to communicate that w/the staff cuz I don‚Äôt think the POS has a way to note that. And if you just say ‚Äú3 almond/oat/coconut‚Äù some stores are eyeballing it and are more bound to mess it up. 

And of course please be kind and patient! We are overworked and usually understaffed. Having a better idea of what exactly you‚Äôre looking for helps us not have to remake it, and helps you get more than a splash of milk lol",Life hacks to get more milk/alt-milk in your drink

DunkinDonuts,"I have PTSD, ADHD, Borderline, and autism. And, one of my Mexicans has terrible side effects like making me forget things. I have to take Adderall, drink tons of coffee, hit my vape constantly, smoke weed and take kratom to feel and act  normal. 

I'm actually overqualified to work here, but I want to work here because I don't have enough self esteem to work at the type of job I studied for and I don't want to sit in an office all day right now.

Nothing wrong with working at Dunkin, I eat here every day! 

I worked here for a month in 2018 at a different location and the management was horrible. 

She hid in the utility closet aka her ""office"" her whole shift and never trained me! 

Just threw me right in! It was bad. When I switched to night shift, the woman working with me bullied me into quitting because she preferred working alone to keep the whole 10 dollars in tips she made. 

My current manager has been working at DD SINCE 2000 and interviewed me for 45 mins. She told me this location used to be really rough and the old owner ""left""  and a whole new crew came in including her. 

I then went and trained at another location to watch DU videos with a very nice HR lady. Everything seems to be going well but I'm worried about moving too slow or making too many mistakes or getting yelled at by massholes. Normal people can handle this but cue PTSD and high functioning autism. 

I think maybe a lot of people who work food service, could be similar to me. How do you handle it? I used to be a waitress for years and I honestly don't remember how I did it. Sorry if this is really long!!!

DunkinDonuts,"Hello, I am a dunkin employee, and during the pre-February window, i made a little post where i went through each of the new items before they were widely known, and I missed the valentines/March one, so I guess I'll do it now. Since there's only three new items, (somehow, lemonade is already on backorder... geez.) I'll also give some personal drink recommendations and a weird story.

&amp;#x200B;

Cake Batter Swirl (in a small iced coffee, cream only): Okay, this is the one I was looking forward to the most. I love cake batter flavored things, and this was pretty great. For some reason, when pumping it it comes out thin so ask for a little extra. It's sweet, but when trying to mix swirls together it gets muddied up by the other flavors. 8/10

Butter Pecan (in a small iced coffee, cream only): When I got hired last September, we still had some and god, there is definitely a reason why everyone loves it. It's sweet, nutty, everything great. I don't care if the ice cream market looks at it as a geezer flavor, it's a 10/10!

Mango Pineapple Refresher (sample cup of pure concentrate): Okay not gonna lie, it's underwhelming. It just tastes pineappley with not much other substance to it. My mistake for doing that. 4/10 

Mango Pineapple Refresher (Green Tea): The green tea brings something out of it at least, giving it some depth besides fruitiness. 6/10.

Mango Pineapple Refresher (Coconutmilk): I'm sorry, but if I'm going to try this, I need an ambulance crew on standby. A little coconut is fine, but having a drink being half-coconut milk would probably kill me

&amp;#x200B;

Now we're in the weird stuff

Strawberry Shortcake 2.0: Ask for a vanilla bean coolata with 2 pumps strawbery and a non-cautious amount of cake batter. If you thought the vanilla bean + strawberry on it's own was great, try that.

""Illegal"" Lemonade Refreshers: If your dunkin has bottled lemonade, ask for any of the refreshers with just concentrate and room in the cup. Put the lemonade in. This has been my go to drink for the past few weeks.

Butter Pecan Hot Chocolate: As simple as it says. Butter pecan swirl, hot chocolate. Good stuff, even despite the tummy trouble because coconut oil in the hot choc

Plain Yeast Donut: So... our baker called out 2 days ago so we had way too much stock. Out of curiosity, I bit into one of the plain, unfrosted yeast rings and... EUGH! It's floury and salty with nothing really redeeming to it. It's like scraping the underside of 20 English muffins and not toasting them. If you see that hollow excuse of something out as a Baker's Choice, avoid it!",I tried the new available flavors so you don't have to (again!)

DunkinDonuts,Not sure why but every cup of iced coffee I‚Äôve gotten lately is bitter. I hardly even enjoy going to Dunkin‚Äô anymore. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs just a swirl thing as I was a Hazelnut drinker when there aren‚Äôt any seasonal options.

DunkinDonuts,"I know this has been asked before, but I'm having difficultly finding an exact answer. Some articles say it's a tablespoon, some articles a teaspoon. Most articles say a small gets 2 cream, medium 3 cream, large 4 cream, etc. What they don't say is how much (in tablespoons, teaspoons, or milliliters) is 1 cream, exactly? 

I know they use light cream (not half n' half), but 3 tablespoons of light cream for a medium does sound like a lot of cream for 14oz of coffee. That coffee is creamy though :)  


Second question - is the cream included in the total volume of a coffee, or is it the 10, 14, 20 oz coffee plus appropriate cream amount?

DunkinDonuts,"          After almost 15 years (&amp; it being my first job ever after high school), I was currently recently let go from a job at a Medical Lift Chair Factory because of a sudden onset of Vertigo that I never had up until this point. (Couldn't return to old original position, because of physical therapy taking too long for them to me to go back to original position.). I am now in a way better place with my Vertigo. It only shows up sporadically and not as often as in the beginning.                                                          I want to maybe see if I can thrive in another type of work environment, (not factory). I definitely feel I can. I've been going to Dunkin for years &amp; have had an interest in coffee in what is involved. I saw they were hiring near me. It's a location inside a gas station for Crew Member. Also, even if it's a regular location &amp; if I see that in the future I may consider applying, too. If you can, please consider giving any honest advice that you can. Sorry for the long post.

DunkinDonuts,"I just want to order an iced mocha with coconut milk. Sometimes I get mocha latte, sometimes it‚Äôs a brewed coffee with mocha in it, sometimes it‚Äôs an iced coffee. Today, it was a large iced coffee with 4 mocha and 4 sugar packets (the sugar I did not ask for‚Ä¶). Is this standard? I work at Starbucks, so I just assume a mocha (as in a latte with mocha in it) is called the same everywhere. I‚Äôve tried saying cafe mocha or iced latte with mocha in it, but it always seems to come back with some addition I didn‚Äôt ask for.

DunkinDonuts,"I had one of the most degrading and disrepectful experiences I have ever had at a Dunkin in the Nashville area.  This was not, by any means, the first time, I had been treated badly or left unhappy with the poor service, but this time, it was so bad, I neither got the manager I wanted to speak to when I was coldly told I had an attitude, and I was told to leave without getting part of the order I had already paid for.

In my frustration, I sent an email to Dunkin customer relations, relaying the experience, the complete lack of customer service, and the fact that they didn't even try to provide a substitute, but just told me to leave.

I got back a boilerplate email response, telling me that my experience had gone to the franchisee, and I was refunded the total of the item I had been denied.

Considering the absolutely horrendous experience I had, I am not putting up with such a canned response.  After multiple terrible experiences, and now getting such an uncaring and shallow response, it's time to forget about the loyalty program, and just grab a coffee or doughnut where I think might work.  7-eleven has them, Kroger has a doughnut bakery.  We have Thornton's in the area.  Krispy Kremes are around.  I am not going to throw my money at a company that gives me such a bad experience every few months.

DunkinDonuts,I‚Äôm just curious what Dunkins policy is when it comes to the employees putting on the butter or cream cheese on bagels and muffins. It‚Äôs super inconsistent on which places will do it for you and which places won‚Äôt. Literally on the menu there are two options for butter/CC which say on the food itself or on the side. But some stores will refuse to put the butter/CC on themselves and force the customer to do it which makes no sense because if I‚Äôm coming through a drive through asking for a muffin heated with butter why would I want to put it on myself? Especially with a crappy plastic knife while I‚Äôm driving? So does it just come down to the laziness of the employee or do certain locations not allow their employees to put it on themselves? For example my girlfriend just got a muffin heated with butter and they told her they only put the butter on the side. Even though it‚Äôs on the menu that you can order with butter on it. So I‚Äôm convinced since some places do it and some don‚Äôt it‚Äôs just laziness but wanted to know whether there was some sort of local franchise policy forbidding it.,Putting butter/cream cheese on bagels/muffins

DunkinDonuts,"TL/DR: I'm an overwhelmed employee who used to really enjoy my job but now my work is draining me more and more and I feel torn. 

I'm getting to that point where I want to quit for real this time. I'm the main Baker, and during the golden age of my employment as I call it (last spring/early summer) I really loved my job. I made a lot of friends and work didn't feel like work. 

But in the fall of last year, things got pretty blah and now things are just getting bad. We got bought out by a big company and they're making so many changes, like the dress code. We're even changing how the donut case is organized and specific kinds of donuts go into assorted dozens now, which led to us running out of blueberry at like 7am. And I love the way I organized my donuts and I don't want to be told what to do in the one thing where I felt like I had creative freedom... Corporate obviously doesn't listen to what we feel is best and what works for our individual store. 

Worst part, there's literally so much drama lately! I almost walked out today because my coworkers are like going at each other's throats. I'm going to feel bad if I end up leaving because I know how hard it is to find a Baker. But this place has been sucking the life out of me for the past year and a half overall and I can't anymore. This isn't even to mention how the customers in the town that I work can be so mean and racist as well. We've had sandwiches thrown at us, direct threats, and some people have used terrible derogatory terms that I won't repeat here. All have been banned by our store, but similar people eventually take their place. The kind people get fewer and far between no matter how nice I am to them. All of it makes me dread coming in to work. 

I miss our old manager, but our newer manager is awesome and I know he's trying his best and he's doing well. I don't want to let him down. But I just can't do the drama anymore or the early mornings or people yelling at me. It's getting real bad for my mental health. I would be sad to leave but maybe it really is time.

DunkinDonuts,"I only workers there for two and a half weeks. At first everything was fine. Yes I‚Äôd get yelled at for being to slow even in my first day when I was learning despite the fact my average time came in around 2 minutes. I would get 30hrs a week and it stayed like that my second week. I enjoyed it at the time and my coworkers are great people.  But once my third week came I only got 16hrs. I worked the first shift but it was only 4hrs. When I came in for my second one this morning I looked around and ended up walking out. 

That may seem sudden but on top of getting yelled at no matter how fast I got (average prep time for my kitchen job was 1 minute) getting told I‚Äôll only be getting up to 12 hrs a week from next week onwards and having to wake up at 04:30 every morning I worked well I just couldn‚Äôt justify it.

I was only making $12.50 per hour so gas alone would cost more to come to and from then I would make. Throw in my monthly bills so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford it. Thus leading to me resigning this morning because sadly it was the more financially viable option. 

If it wasn‚Äôt for the low hours I‚Äôd still be working there and would of been working when I‚Äôm typing this but with my low pay and the fact id be spending more money in gas then I‚Äôd make in a pay period on top of the low hours and  pay less to me leaving. I also have bills to pay so spending more on gas then I‚Äôd make made the hours with such low pay even more unjustifiable.

For one of them, it seems to vary across their stores. Almond milk used to be $0.50 across the board. But now only some of their stores have it at $0.50.

For their other stores, almond milk is $0.59 if it‚Äôs ADDED to a drink, like a hot/iced coffee or cold brew with almond milk in it. And if a drink is MADE with almond milk, like a latte or cappuccino made with almond milk, they now charge $1.09 for it.

I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that almond milk is costing this much now. Why won‚Äôt they keep it as $0.50? Lots of people have dairy allergies or intolerances.

The hazelnut shot is terrible. Barely noticeable. Maybe even a little bitter. French vanilla swirl is too sweet and caramel swirl is the same. I just don't understand. Isn't hazelnut the second most beloved flavor of coffee after french vanilla? Why would they get of a coffee staple? I'm baffled. 

Today, I sip a Dunkin coffee with a hazelnut shot plus cream &amp; sugar. The hazelnut swirl would cover up the stale coffee taste. Now all I can do is wallow.

The Dunkin I work at has always had trouble and rarely keeps employees for more than 3 months at a time so they brought in a new district manager (I think that‚Äôs the right term) and he has cracked down on a lot of stuff but taking away breaks like that has to not be allowed right?

This may boil down to my misunderstanding what the actual difference is? Like when I make iced coffee at home and I add 1 oz of half and half or milk to 10 oz of coffee, the entire drink turns that creamy light brown, wheras 2 times now my iced coffee + milk has been totally dark like nothing was added.

DunkinDonuts,"Hi everyone, I've had a perplexing morning and was hoping to get some answers from the loyal fans of DD, 

Full disclosure, I've never been to Dunkin Donuts before today. Before I met my wife, I'd spent the majority of my life in a small town where your best bet for coffee drinks was Mcdonald's (even that was only after they introduced the McCafe line-up). I'd heard of DD and seen some commercials, but never actually been to one myself. 

My wife and I currently live in a more populated area with tons of options for coffee (not joking, I didn't know what a macchiato was until I was 32), and today on my way home from work she asked me to stop in the Dunkins drive-through. One iced coffee with 10 creams 4 sugars, and a side of mini hashbrowns. 

Here's where it gets prickly, at the end, she mentioned she wanted an order of ""Dumpy Dunks"". When I asked her what those were she said they were similar to donut holes. When I pulled up to the drive-through window to place the order, everything went smooth until I couldn't find ""Dumpy Dunks"" anywhere on the menu. I asked the person taking my order if they had been discontinued and after a while of pausing he said he didn't remember that product ever being sold in store (he also mentioned that he was new). For the next 5 minutes, I waited as he asked different employees in the store if they had ever sold ""Dumpy Dunks"", all of which said no. 

Is it possible this item was regional? Or did I just get pranked by my wife?","New To Dunkins, Might have Gotten Pranked by My Wife"

DunkinDonuts,"So it seems like four out of five times that I ask for flavor shots instead of swirls (which is always), I get my cup and look at the tag on the side to see ""Swirls"" listed despite asking for Shots. This is at multiple different Dunkins throughout the state. I am on a very low-sugar diet, so it's basically a wasted coffee for me at that point unless I inevitably give it to someone else. However, what boggled my mind was a few hours ago when this happened to me I made my order (iced coffee, stevia, oat milk, 4 french vanilla flavor shots) and was asked to confirm if I meant ""unsweetened french vanilla"".   


I was under the impression that all of the flavor shots were ""unsweetened"" so I said yes. Couldn't go wrong that way, right? Got my coffee and it had 4 Swirls listed on the tag.  


Am I doing something wrong in ordering? Is it possible that they actually are flavor shots but are simply misprinted on the tag (I ask this because I've had family taste-test my coffee and say that it tastes too bland/not sweet enough to be full of Swirls).

DunkinDonuts,"Why is this important to know? Because I‚Äôve noticed a lot of posts in this sub questioning why their Dunks has different rules/policies/procedures/deals etcetera.

Please, as a former employee, stop using the ‚Äúthey do it for me at X Dunkins‚Äù because honestly we don‚Äôt care what they do for you at another store we have to follow the rules of our location and if we cant give you something because our jobs are at stake,  people take it out on the employees. It‚Äôs just something to remember. Similar to many fast food places. Franchises run the majority so uniformity will not be identical between stores. Things like quality obviously SHOULD be identical but dunkins and many other places have struggled during this pandemic and training for new employees is basically nothing. They‚Äôre thrown on the floor and told to start working day 1 or day 2, I‚Äôve seen it. If a mistake happens just be polite about it. And remember different franchises have different policies.

Wtf is going on. I randomly go to a different location to see if has gotten better but it hasn't. Even the hashbrowns have that taste. Is it the way the oven is cleaned? Upper management? Or is it the employees trying to encourage us customers to not order food?

DunkinDonuts,"two parts to this rant:

1) i am the closing shift lead at my store, and tonight i was closing with our newest hire (i've only closed w them twice). they had to leave at 7:00 (when our store closes) because they had another engagement to attend that night, and as long as the store is closed well, i'm super chill w my workers, so i told them that if we buckled down and really got to work we could probably get out at 7:00. i started assigning them a few tasks, and got to work on tasks that i think take the longest and rarely get done well (i.e. dishes, restocking/cleaning sandwich, cleaning taps, mopping). however, when i checked in on the other closer, they had taken off their headset and were making tiktoks. frequently throughout the night, they were taking 30 min bathroom breaks, making tiktoks, or just standing around. they refused to put their headset back on, leaving me to take orders, make food and drinks, and do the closing tasks myself. when they took out the trash, a bag split open. they came in and told me, so i told them that if there was plastic and shit everywhere they should sweep it up. they got upset and said ""fine, i guess ill go sweep the street."" they left with a broom, but after we finished closing and were walking to our cars i saw with my own eyes that they had not swept it up as there was still plastic and shit everywhere. i couldnt even clean it up because the store was locked. on top of all of that, when i asked them to finish up dishes, they looked at me angry and asked what i was going to do. as if im not the shift lead. as if i hadnt done the majority of the close by myself. anyways. im not the confrontational type, but if tomorrow wasnt my last day i wouldve become the confrontational type. 

2) my store is completely short staffed and has been since i started. however, the whole store is falling apart now. my manager, assistant manager, and the other shift lead along with about 3-4 other employees are all quitting. tomorrow is my last day. there will only be abt 3 ppl on staff after this week. our dunkin upper management has been awful to us. forcing us to cut hours for everyone, having maybe two ppl on the clock while having our lobby and drive thru open, overworking salary employees with no compensation. everyone is fed up. our store is falling apart.

DunkinDonuts,"Before i start, i want to say that I have worked on Valentines day before. While not at dunkin, i worked at a flower shop that is a big staple of my city, so I know the rush that popular stores get on this day firsthand

I‚Äôve only experienced one holiday at Dunkin so far and it was Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving as a holiday was one i didn‚Äôt expect to be so pressuring, we had a line around the store and inside the lobby with the drink tickets nearly hitting the floor at some points. It was an extremely stressful and pressuring day that lead me to have at least 2 breakdowns due to the fast-paced environment my brain couldn‚Äôt keep up with.

My coworkers have already warned me about Valentines day, they say its awful, and I can only imagine it both from personal experience and then comparing that with how thanksgiving was, I don‚Äôt think I would be emotionally prepared to handle it. 

I‚Äôd like to take off both to keep myself out of pressure and for my own stress not to put more pressure on my coworkers who witness me break from the weight. I‚Äôve already put in the request form but have gotten no reply or such yet. My main fear is that my coworkers will see me as lazy or unreliable for bailing on them on such a busy holiday but a part of me says i‚Äôd rather them be mad at me for that than have them deal with my mental state taking such a hit by trying to keep a pace i may not be able to, even if ive taken my medication.",Is it wrong for me to request off for valentines day?

Lmk if you try and like it!!",BEST MATCHA DRINK EVER!!!
DunkinDonuts,"I want to begin this post by reminding everyone that it is illegal for your employer to retaliate against you for discussing your wages, and if they do so, sue the pants off of them.

At my Dunkin, I make $14.50/hour. The state minimum wage is $14.25. We get a raise every new year, when the state increases the minimum wage, and that‚Äôs it. The openers, closers, and shift leaders all make the same amount ($14.50) as well. 

When Covid first hit, we had $2 added on to our check for every hour we worked (so if you worked 20 hours, $40 would be added to your check, not an extra $2/hour. Apparently we‚Äôre not worth that much even during a global pandemic). Last year, in I believe November, they added an extra $1/hour raise to our pay that was supposed to be permanent as well (Minimum wage then was $13.50/hour, so we were making $14.50/hour). That was the last raise we saw.

The pay is really insulting, especially with basically no benefits. We can get health insurance thru Dunkin at my location, but it is very expensive and covers jack shit. Next door at McDonald‚Äôs, they get $17/hour with tuition coverage, and other benefits as well as better pay. The other 2 stores I work next to also pay about ~$17/hour. Why shouldn‚Äôt my coworkers and I all quit and work there? Even other franchises offer better benefits. In the next town over from mine, there is a franchise that will pay your tuition. And for having to get food out the drive thru window in 150 seconds or less, it‚Äôs ridiculously low.

I also don‚Äôt count tips in this, as some stores make worse tips and some shifts also have worse tips than others, and they really should be paying us more anyway. It‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt have the money.

Just some thoughts though.",How much do you get paid at your Dunkin? (Not including tips)

So curious if that's a per-store level decision or we have to go to the Franchisee. If it matters, the main franchisee around us is Andrade Group (NH)...","When cold cup designs change are old cups tossed, recycled, or it varies?"

DunkinDonuts,"To start - in case this is regional - I live in central Virginia.   The three stores near me have decals on the windows saying something like DD Perk Members - Free Medium or Hot on Wednesdays.  I went to a store last Wednesday and ordered a medium iced.  I showed my app at the drive thru and it deducted the full price from my gift card.  I then asked for a receipt and it showed I paid for the coffee.  I then told the worker it was supposed to be free.  He said he did not know of any promo.  He then asked the manager and she said she knew about the sign but if the register did not take it off as free there is nothing she can do.  She said it did not show as free in ‚Äúoffers‚Äù section of the app and I should only count on it as a promo if it shows in the offers section.  

I contacted DD customer service through the app and they gave me a free beverage coupon to even in out.  

I looked in the app again today to see if it was a listed offer and it was not.  I did not want to go through the same thing as last week.  Does anyone know if I had an issue with just one store or is this promo not running yet (despite being plastered on the windows)?",Wednesday Free Promo?

I had a terrible experience today on my way to work.   Ordered a black pepper bacon sandwich, but charged for a  maple sugar bacon sandwich, then when I get to work and take out my sandwich, it is just some bacon on a crossoint, no egg.

The phone number goes straight to voice-mail, then tells me the mailbox is full so I have to drive back after work.

The doors are locked(I know, pandemic) so I have to go back thru the drive thru.  Finally able explain what happened and am told no refunds, but they will give the correct sandwich.  I ordered the sandwich for breakfast 6 hours earlier, it does me nothing to finally get it now nor does it address my wasted time.


So I am asking, do you guys really refuse refunds when you mess up someone's order?  Or am I dealing with a poorly run franchise?

I'm not an employee (just a frequent customer) and this one location by my job lost it's manager around the time covid started. Since then there's been 2 replacements and OOF!...When I tell you I find it so uncomfortable to visit anymore. It's one of the only locations I actually walk into and usually have to wait for a bit due to it being a busy location, so as a result I see a lot of employee interactions. Both managers who have taken over since the pandemic started are legitimately awful during all of them. I understand it's a stressful work environment, but they BERATE the workers who are busting their asses doing orders and seem to have no shame doing it in front of dozens of customers. I never speak up (nor does anyone else), but it makes me feel so uncomfortable. Is it like this everywhere (like are dunkin managers just jerks)? More importantly, is there a way to report it?

Before I explain my story, please note that I am NOT a lazy person, I am extremely active and exercise as much as a I can. I was actually pretty thin a decade ago.

When I started working third shift, I became addicted to coffee (which sounds like it'd be obvious lol).  My town had just been introduced to Dunkin's iced coffees (keep in mind this was 14 years ago).  I would get a coffee every so often, then it turned into every day.  I can honestly say for the last 10 years, I've had at least one iced coffee a day from Dunkin Donuts. And also for the last 10 years, I've struggled losing weight no matter how hard I worked out.  I've been checked by my doctor for various things, nothing shows as to why I cannot lose the weight.

My boyfriend (who has always been rail thin) just recently started drinking a lot of dunkin and starbucks and now he has a little belly on him.  I am starting to put two and two together here.

Today, I am quitting my dunkin habit. I know it'll be hard but I feel I need to do it. my body is suffering because of a daily coffee routine I became addicted to.

DunkinDonuts,"I got home last night and decided to save my coffee from tmr, I was annoyed they gave me 1 caramel swirl and 1 cream for my LARGE that's obviously not the standard and I was gonna have to add stuff to it myself... WELL it's tomorrow I pour my coffee into a new cup and three black beads fall into the cup! And they were decently big! Like how do you miss that. Did your bracelets break and it not make a splash?

I really just suck up their mistakes. When my mini bagels are frozen solid I throw them in my microwave. When my coffee or tea is messed up I fix it at home. When they give me the wrong donuts I just it. When they forget to give me a whole item I'll just nicely go in and ask for it. I don't want to bother them they only get paid minimum wage. But to have beads in my coffee?? I think I gotta draw the line somewhere. So I call them. I explain that there were bracelet beads in my coffee. And they person says ""uh"" THE HANGS UP ON ME!! Ugh I can't even I'm so done with this location idec if it's the closet one with a drive through, I'm never going to it again!",Ugh the Dunkin closest to me is absolutely atrocious not only do they always mess orders up (from giving frozen solid mini bagels to simply messing up coffees) THERE THREE BRACELETS BEADS IN MY COFFEE!

DunkinDonuts,"So when I go to dunkin and order just one donut, every now and then the person gives me extra donuts. I understand if they do it at night and don't want it to go to waste, but sometimes it happens in the morning too. Are they doing it out of kindness? Am I supposed to say an extra thanks? Am I supposed to pretend like they didn't do it? One time I ordered 1 Boston creme donut and they gave 4! It was at 10am. Then I realized the person probably saw the 4 from the 4 caramels from my large drink and thought the donut was also 4 instead of 1.  But one day I ordered 1 and they gave 2. And it's not like they see me as a regular or anything. Just wondering if others have same experience.",Giving extra donuts
DunkinDonuts,"I was at DFW earlier this year, and I tried paying for my drink with a gift card. The cashier gave me a weird look and said they didn‚Äôt accept gift cards.

DunkinDonuts,"But I actually *prefer* Dunkin lattes to Starbucks lattes.

Dunkin was always too watered down for me years ago. It didn't have a good rep with me in regards to coffee. Eventually I stopped drinking Starbucks years ago. 

But recently I've been getting a latte here and there, comparing them to Dunkin's lattes. And I prefer the taste of Dunkin. The flavoring is better. The espresso isn't as bitter as Starbucks. Starbucks has been hit or miss for me.

DunkinDonuts,"Im still working at dunkin, obviously. Recently i got switched from drinks to order taking/window because i have a naturally pleasant voice, which my franchise owner really liked.

Whenever its very slow (to the point of no cars and no tickets) i usually draw on the back of leftover receipts people don‚Äôt want when i cash them out. Im an artist and it also acts as a stimulation for me and keeps me grounded. Sometimes i may doodle while we get a bit of business too, but I put my order taking duties before my art.

However, we‚Äôve also got cameras and one faces right into the drive thru area. One of the shift leaders has been watching the cameras from her home (word of mouth suggests that she can see them on her phone or computer) and she doesn‚Äôt like the routine i give myself. So for the past weeks ive found that my drawings have now been getting thrown away when i walk away from the drive thru area to get a donut/munchkins, or that the pens im using seem to always be in use by someone else. 

However, the yesterday and today i‚Äôve found that my coworkers have started taking the pens (as seen by me finding one of them hiding the pen i just used in their pocket), and me coming in and all the pens suddenly being taken off the drive-thru area to restrict me from doing so.

My coworkers have never really minded my artistic habits, in fact they like seeing my art from time to time. Even though i prioritize my work, it sucks to see that they would go as far as to hide pens from me.",Day 40-something: they‚Äôve started hiding the pens from me.

DunkinDonuts,"Can anyone please explain why Dunkin Donuts changed their coffee lids from the old fashioned design where the lid plug was integrated in the lid and now the newer style has the open mouthpiece with the separate plastic dipstick? This design sucks for a few reasons‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢ This change took place around Covid starting. Why would you want to incorporate a separate plastic piece that must be handled by the employee before it goes into your drink? I‚Äôve seen the bins they are kept in behind the counter. Not sanitary and the employee touches multiple sticks each time they reach for one.
‚Ä¢ It is inconvenient when you just want to reach for your drink with one hand but now have a dipstick to pull out first.
‚Ä¢ When you remove the dipstick you sometimes have to put it down somewhere if you plan on taking multiple sips before replugging. Now you are potentially introducing the stick to more germs when placing it down.
‚Ä¢ Wouldn‚Äôt it cost more money for this design since you are now bringing in additional inventory at each location? 
‚Ä¢ Isn‚Äôt this adding to waste and impacting the environment that you market yourself caring about?

DunkinDonuts,I've beengoing to Dunkin on Fridays as my end of the week treat but last time I went I noticed the prices for my go to breakfast (wake up wraps and hashbrowns) have almost doubled. One wake up wrap is now 3.49 and it boggles my mind as to why it's so much so suddenly? Anyone know a possible reason or it just the way it's going to be? I'm really disappointed about this üòï,Hue price increase?
DunkinDonuts,"I'm sure I'm in the small minority that liked the Apple Cranberry Refresher, I acknowledge it tasted like a candle but I loved that sugary candle drink anyway! Two days ago I was in a Dunkin and it was just the normal two refresher flavors, but today I went to a different store and they had the AC on the menu board and I obviously got it.  I'm curious if that store is a weird one-off or if it's back now, I want to get more while I still can!",Is the Apple Cranberry Refresher back everywhere?

DunkinDonuts,"If you work at my location and see this post, no you didnt.

To run some things by off the bat, I'm 19, this is my second job, and I have autism, adhd, and anxiety. All of these I try not to have hinder my work while on on the clock, but sometimes events get the best of me.

Today a woman, her relative/friend, and a young boy approached the register. The woman's friend/relative ordered for her, she said 3 blueberry donuts and a coffee roll. I repeated this back to her and she confirmed it. I cashed her out, gave her change, the whole one two. I'm already a few hours into my shift and its a rush hour so i'm a bit tired, annoyed, and very slightly overwhelmed.

I grab a bag for the donuts. she says she wants a box. annoying ok sure. I grab a box for 6 donuts and start putting them in there. no, thats the wrong box. At this point I had barely known about muffin boxes, so I was confused on what other box there was. My coworker grabs a muffin box. ok cool.

I put the donuts in the box. At this point shes now questioning why im giving her donuts, and tells me she ordered *muffins.* While its a common mistake especially when my hearings fucked from wearing a headset all day, it was tipping me off my mental edge. I knew if I didn't go to the back and take a breather I would snap *at* her. My emotions were already tipping, so I turn around towards the back and just go ""ineedaminuteineedaminutepleasegivemeaminute"" *(repeating sentences when im stressed is a mental response of mine, though I'm not sure what its fully linked to its usually based on people not listening to me the first time)* and when I did come back out after letting some of my anger/stress out, the womans at the counter pointing and screaming at me.

I couldn't hear what she was saying fully, but the jist of it was shit like im disrespectful, i was yelling at her, etc. and my coworkers told me to just ignore her, meaning I couldnt even explain myself / tell her that I was never *intending* to yell at her. And once she left my coworkers basically took a side with her, saying that I was being disrespectful to her and even if I didn't snap at her like I almost did, if my franchise owner saw the video they would insist the customer would be right. 

It's annoying. the customer is always right. that I don't have the chance or right to defend something I did that was taken the wrong way. I don't *want* or *like* to get overwhelmed like that, and no matter how hard i try to keep it from does happening, when it does im still seen as wrong, or annoying, or hard to work with.","""the customer is always right"" annoyance (rant/vent)"
DunkinDonuts,"alright, I‚Äôm a future shift leader at my store and while we could use 1 or 2 more morning people, we have a decent crew and we definitely aren‚Äôt understaffed. No one is currently brand new besides a girl training for overnights 


I‚Äôve worked every shift and have about 2 years total experience at DD- I‚Äôm not sure how long it‚Äôs been since my store had tried to make time as I actually came back about a month and a half ago now and I was overnights until these past two weeks! 

I want to try and. Push my crew to start making time, but most of them started when our store was a ‚Äújust please be here and make coffee and take peoples money‚Äù rather than being efficient and trying to keep the 80% and up. 

My manager asked me to make a list of pointers to share with other shift leaders and her as kind of focal points based off of what I had seen, and this is what I have so far

	‚ÅÉ	if you are not busy with customers and you see someone needs help , HELP- especially drive they, drive thru is priority 
	‚ÅÉ	Everyone should be listening for orders to help the OT
	‚ÅÉ	If the OT is busy and you arent, try to jump in and help take orders or run donuts to drive thru
	‚ÅÉ	Keep things stocked, if you can‚Äôt get off of your station then ask someone who iant busy to grab something for you
	‚ÅÉ	Be efficient, OT should be starting espresso shots for coffees so they are done and the drinks are done faster
	‚ÅÉ	OT should be setting up orders for the window, they should be seeing the next order and making sure everything is ready for hand out
	‚ÅÉ	Sandwich station always should have batches of hash browns, snackin bacon, eggs bacon maple bacon and sausage
	‚ÅÉ	When not busy sandwich station should stock and fill bagels in the station as well as make sure everything is filled like cheese sNd meats and other breads
	‚ÅÉ	Coffees should be making multiple drinks at a time, never one at a time unless there is only one drink to make
	‚ÅÉ	OT should be putting orders in quickly and repeating orders as you go to ensure complete accuracy, be personable and make them feel like you want them there! 
	‚ÅÉ	Drive thru if you need help, SAY you need help whether it‚Äôs sandwiches coffees or something else
	

Soooo, what other ideas do you guys have for pushing my crew to start making time? I know some of you will find this post dumb, but I really want to make my store fast again. We used to have an amazing crew who would make time most days of the week and I think we can get there again with our current group!",tips for making time with newer crew?

DunkinDonuts,"Literally on my last day working at Dunkin' because I quit: I was juggling stations like window, front, drinks, and food and I was on Window where I was cashing out this lady and she gave me some change extra so that she could get a dollar back. No problem. I put in the amount and the cash register opens buuuuut there were literally no dollar bills in it, I told my shift lead and he said he'd come back to change it out since he was doing drawers already. So I told the customer, ""hey we don't have dollars would you like me to give it back to you and give you your original change amount?"" She looked at me like I didn't know what I was doing and said, ""No i gave you the change to get a dollar back, please?"" Ugh. Ok. So I gave her 20 nickels, because we didn't fking have quarters either. Well this makes her upset and she goes, ""Wow!

DunkinDonuts,"Hey all. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has been noticing the coffee at their local Dunkin has been considerably more acidic lately - most notably the iced coffee. 

My husband has been drinking 1-3 large iced coffees a day for literally decades and recently, he has complained the smell seems different. Then he started really feeling ill after drinking it and even vomited once. 

He‚Äôs had to give it up for now (I‚Äôm  making him hot tea at home before he leaves for work and he‚Äôs making the same for himself while on the job site) and I‚Äôve been giving him some acid reducing meds and it‚Äôs really helped. He hasn‚Äôt had a problem since he gave it up. 

He‚Äôs jonesing to go back to the iced coffee but I‚Äôm 100% against it. Has the quality of the beans gone down? Is this an issue that could be in one store but not others or do all Dunkin franchises use the exact same coffee beans?

DunkinDonuts,,‚ÄúTime To Make The Doughnuts‚Äù Advert Campaign Launched in 1981
DunkinDonuts,"My sister just recently started working at Dunkins about late September to maybe early October in Gales Ferry, Connecticut from 6am-10am. She loved her job at the store she worked at by as of late November, she was transferred to a Gas Station/Dunkins in Groton, Connecticut where she'd be working 12pm-5pm. Now here comes the real story...and I'm sure I'm not even supposed to post this here but I am so PISSED off it's not even funny and I will spread this where ever I need too in order for Dunkins to see it and feel the fucking heat because Dunkins has removed my facebook post and my twitter post from their page. My sister is 18 years old, has high functioning autism and high anxiety. She applied to Dunkins as a way to help support the household since her father passed away in August, she was happy at the Gales Ferry one; she loved the manager there, she loved her co-workers, and as much as she hated being transferred...she dealt with it. She was there for all of 2, maybe 3 days, before that store manager tells her ""You're closing tomorrow."" on her way out. My sister was scared, she was never trained to close Dunkins and assumed someone would be with her the next day...she was wrong. She was given tasks/assignments that she had literally NO idea how to do because she wasn't trained in closing the store...she was always out of work by 5:05pm at the latest while someone else closed.  


We had no idea about the no training and also assumed someone would be there with her. I went into the gas station to let her know her ride was there but to also get something to drink and snack on from the gas station only to see my sister on her own, almost in tears because she was so stressed and her anxiety was through the roof. She was alone and as much as the Henny Penny employee wanted to help her, she couldn't in fear of getting in trouble. So I hung around the gas station, which the Henny Penny employee was okay with, and watched as my sister struggled to do her tasks. She was supposed to be at 5:00pm and she assumed she'd be there for maybe an extra 30 minutes closing but she was there till about 7:45pm. The manager watching her from home on the cameras and speaking to my sister like she was a fucking idiot on the phone. The management basically threw my sister to the wolves expecting her to know how to do everything. Oh but here's the kicker...you all know we gotta wear masks everywhere right? Whether you support them or not, you know we gotta wear them cause of covid. Well my sister has a low immune system due a livery and kidney issue and our mom has a VERY low immune system due to 2 autoimmune diseases and she went into work on the first day and wore her mask for about an hour, she went outside to get some fresh air real quick when the manger of that store went after her and told her not to wear her mask because ""it looked unprofessional."" and when my sister tired to fight it, telling them WHY she needed the mask...they threatened to let her go and in fear of loosing her job, she complied. Nobody should be afraid to loose their job because they want to protect them themselves and their loved ones by wearing a fucking mask.

So the next day, December 3 2021, my sister called that store manager and told her she was done. She couldn't handle being left alone and that she was more a team player than a solo player, which that manager rudely remarked ""made no sense"" and hung up on her. On December 4th, my sister messaged the overall manager, I'm not sure which kind of manager she is but she's the one who hired her and she manages multiple Groton, CT stores and explained the situation and how she wasn't given any training on how to close, to which the woman rudely remarked was ridiculous, she had two or three months worth of training and it was stupid of my sister to even claim that before saying 'Your checks SHOULD be available on Friday""....excuse me? SHOULD?! Then she ends it with ""No response necessary"" when my sister was telling her sorry for wasting her time, thanks for the opportunity, and which store was she supposed to pick up her check at? The manager never answered her and if we had to guess, she blocked the number.   


This is a DISGUSTING display of management...you need to rethink your management. I apologize for any spelling mistakes, I can look this over a million times and still miss something.",Dunkins needs to rethink management

DunkinDonuts,"I started at dunkin a month ago now. It's my second job and I really enjoy it. The hours are good, the pay is great (better than my last job at least), and my coworkers are really nice people. However one issue i've already had is getting days off.

My family (specifically my father's side) has a vacation planned for after christmas. Not long, from the 28th to the 2nd, so I'd really only be gone 4 days or so. It's 2 hours away, and I can't drive by myself yet (I am over 18 and have a permit). So not only would I want to drive myself to and from my job for 2 hours each, but I don't want anyone else going through the same. 

November 16th. 9 days before thanksgiving I go to request those days off. Not even a month before christmas, not even a month before new years, and my workplace has a notice up that they're not accepting any requests off for christmas eve, new years, or new years day. Considering I was still in training I didn't even have time to learn how to request off, and now I was smacked in the face with there's not a chance I can get off.

My coworkers noticed my panic, and they agreed with me, it's not fair, I had literally no opportunity to request off. I still filled out a forum anyways and did specify that it was a preplanned thing. However I still get the feeling my shift leader is trying to schedule me for the days I specifically said I would be away (especially since i saw my name in with a list of peoples for that day). 

I plan on going anyways. I fear i may get written up so many times that I'm suspended or fired, but i'd rather be with my family, especially since I don't even get paid my dues yet since I can't make tips for another 2 or 3 months (if i pass my tip test the first time)",The pain of getting days off

Old people (65+): hot coffee with a weird combination of splenda, cream on the side, and more often than not served black. Americanos, ‚Äúhalf-caf‚Äù, and stuff from the 50‚Äôs that they think is still on the menu. Paid for in coins. You will fight with them on something. 

Hunters/landscapers/outdoor blue collar workers: Usually smoke a ton and are desensitized to sugar. ‚ÄúExtra large 9 and 10‚Äù is not uncommon. Nuts.*

Homeschoolers: Someone way too old to be going into a Dunkin with their mother. Both order hot chocolate or matcha.

DunkinDonuts,"sorry about formatting and misspellings, bad story telling etc. 


today was nearly my breaking point. i got in at 5am. we‚Äôre severely understaffed especially for our location (highway) new person didnt show up and another called 30 minutes after his shift was meant to start saying he was going to be late because of traffic, only to call in again another 30 minutes later saying he wasnt coming in. i got told i had to stay until 2pm. a 9 hour shift. 

it was extremely busy from 6am to 12pm. the owner refuses to buy us enough supplies to last the week. so we were out of milk, skim milk, sugar, and the ice machine is broken. 

theres 5 of us. one is new. its so deeply stressful the whole time. trying to calm customers down when we say theres no sugar. 

all the 12 oclock people leave. 12 oclock people show up. its me and two others. we get a line wrapped around the building. 

a lady starts ordering. this is basically how it goes. 

Lady: i want a large frozen coffee with caramel coconut and mocha

coworker: large frozen coffee with caramel, coconut and mocha?

lady: NO! i said a large frozen with caramel

coworker: so no coconut or mocha flavoring?

lady: a large frozen coffee. coconut. and mocha. 

coworker: ok, so its a large frozen coffee, with coconut flavoring, and mocha

lady: *loud sigh* I SAID CARAMEL 

coworker: Large coconut, caramel, and mocha?

lady: YES FINALLY YOU GET IT RIGHT. JESUS. 

and she pulls away from the speaker before we can say anything. we are completely confused after she kept changing it and raising her voice. 

she gets to the window, gets her drink and we move on to the next customer. a second later shes still sitting at the window and snapping at us to get out attention. she says her drink is wrong. i read out what was rung up on the register to her. she complains that her coffee is ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù aka: has ice in it. because its a  frozen coffee. so it has shaved ice bits. she says her coffee is NEVER this texture and i try to explain that a frozen coffee is always that texture, or it should be. she raised her voice and repeats her drink to me, differently then she ordered it,  before yelling that shes been waiting too long and just wants her money back. we arent able to do refunds because only the manager is capable of doing that. not that we arent allowed to, but we dont have the option to on the register. 

im at my breaking point. the whole day has been more stressful than any other day here, and ive been working at this location for almost a year. im about to start crying. i quickly tell a coworker she wants her money back so i can step away from the window. 

coworker starts talking to her and trys to explain the situation. she continues yelling at us. claiming she comes here all the time and her drink is NEVER like this. i work 6 days a week. ive never seen her. i dont even know what happened next but suddenly she was gona dn the next car pulled up. now THEYVE been waiting forever because this lady had to yell at us for making her frozen coffee the way she ordered it. 

the first thing out of this next persons mouth is an exacerbated ‚ÄúWHY IS THIS TAKING SO LONG. ARE YOU GUYS UNDERSTAFFED OR SOMETHING?!‚Äù i almost collapsed to the floor crying. 

like dude, you HEARD this lady yelling at us, you KNOW it took so long because she wanted to yell at us. why do you also have to act like this. 

the rest of the line went like this. when the line was finally gone a guy came inside. say my mask and went ‚Äúwhy are you wearing a mask. studies show they dont work you should report your employer‚Äù

my brain just,,,, i couldnt respond. i just lied. said it was required, its not. i just want to keep wearing my mask. i work with food, and chemicals to clean things. i like my mask. i like not breathing on peoples food. not breathing in (as much) chemicals. i just didnt have the mental capacity to respond properly. i knew he was gonna argue with me no matter what i said. i just politely took his order.

DunkinDonuts,"I always order iced coffees from door dash and it never would ask how many of things to add. It would just ask 
Choose your dairy
Choose your flavor shot
Choose your flavor swirl
Choose your sweetener 

So for example I would select like cream, vanilla shot, mocha swirl, liquid sugar (or whatever flavors I was feeling that day)

Now, each option asks how many. So for a large- how many cream, shot, swirl is it generally? I don‚Äôt want to pick 1 and it suck or pick idk 5 and it be straight sugar water lol",Customer question!

The employees usually finish my sentence before I even get halfway through my order.  As far as I know, I have a good employee/customer relationship with everyone there.   This morning, I was told I could not order it in large anymore.  Just small.  I asked why because maybe I could order it a little differently so I could get it in a large.  She said that it's because ""the foam doesn't rise to the top in a large.""  

......what?  What foam?  I tried asking just that, but was told I was holding up the line and to either order a small or get something else.

So, I drove to the Dunkin that's a little past my work, 10 miles away from the one by my house.  I was able to order a large there.  I told the lady there about my experience at the other store and she said she had no idea why the other store said that and that it's ""simply not true about the foam.""

It's really convenient to grab my coffee at the Dunkin near my house. Especially on the weekends when I'm not going to be anywhere near my work.   I'd hate to not be able to go there anymore.

DunkinDonuts,"They've done tried to make improvements to the app over time. But it seems to still run like an app from years ago and not how an app in 2021 should run. It's so slow and choppy and not smooth. I also wish they would update the point system similar to their competitors like Starbucks. Where as the point system is not only based on a free drink. But based on getting different items from the store like pastries, food items, merchandise and etc as you spend more money over time. I feel that would have people coming into the stores even more often if you made it that worth while. Idk this just came in my head as I was browsing the Starbucks app. And realized how much better it runs all together.",I wish Dunkin took some notes from how Starbucks app is

DunkinDonuts,"Okay so today was my third day back and I work overnights at my store! 4 days I do DT and the other two days I‚Äôll be covering the baker‚Äôs days off.

I worked DT today and I got almost everything stocked perfectly; if I were to think about what I didn‚Äôt check it what I definitely missed, it would include:
- filling the sugar dispenser and splenda dispenser
- cutting lemons
- filling cups underneath the drive thru and front counter stations
- I also forgot to check cold brew oops!

What I did do?
- cleaned and fully stocked the donut case (donut and munchkin boxes, made sure bags were full, etc)
- stocked coke cooler and the two mini fridges 
- all 11 remakes
- most of the dishes (I help it the Baker and do most of his when I can)
- trash (got busy so Baker took it to dumpster but I gathered it all)
- stocked sandwich station fully
- ran drive thru ALONE as I do nightly until 5 am
- checked to make sure dairy machines were full
- checked swirls to make sure they weren‚Äôt low
- put bagels and croissants in case and sandwich statiob

My job is not to make up for what other shifts didn‚Äôt stock. Know how many lemons I go through overnight? None. Know what that means? 6-midnight should‚Äôve done it. I didn‚Äôt have time to as it got busy but even then that is not something that should‚Äôve even been empty to be held against me!!!

My night was pretty slow but I‚Äôm also getting used to the grind again as I left at the end of April. I did forget to check the sugar and splenda dispensers but it was busy and all of the morning shift people were there ANYWAYS!!

Okay, on to the important part. First off, I don‚Äôt get out of the window until 6:20 even though I should be clocked out by 6. Whatever, happens all the time idrc . That being said, I‚Äôm already about to be in overtime so I counted my drawer and clocked out‚Ä¶ it was 30 mins into a full on morning shift, they had it handled and if I missed a couple things one f the many people could do it while up front was slow!

I‚Äôm sitting in the back because I didn‚Äôt take a break all night and I figure I‚Äôd talk to my manager when she comes in because I hadn‚Äôt gotten to bullshit with her since coming back.

I guess this morning shift girl didn‚Äôt know I was still in the back because suddenly I hear her talking about how I didn‚Äôt do ‚Äúmuch of any thing ‚Äú and then my other coworkers and friends were telling her that it‚Äôs my third day back and I work on my own all night etc. girl is newer and was all confused talking about how doesnt she have another person? Bitch yeah, the Baker who is baking all night not stocking your sugar machine?

Anyway she talked all this shut literally 20 feet away from me on the other side of the wall because I was in the back and she was talking to the Baker at the bakers table which is very close to the back. 

I‚Äôm like shaking with anger because I was so nice to this girl and she just watched me run order taking and window for an extra 20 minutes over my shift and she has the nerve to be talking shit about someone who works her ass off? So I got up and started telling her all the stuff I do overnight and how I‚Äôm so sorry her sugar and lemons weren‚Äôt full but she has all her remakes and a full donut case etc

She finishes cutting lemons and doesn‚Äôt even look at me and walks to go out them away and I‚Äôm talking louder so she can still hear me and she‚Äôs looking around like ‚Äúwho is she talking to?‚Äù And my Baker is like ‚ÄúYOU‚Äù but then he scolds me and tells me to go sit down because he was already defending me  ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è

Anyways my manager the bajer abd the morning shift lead and I all talked shit about her when my manager came in LMAO AND THE Baker was telling my manager about how much more I do than anyone else here and it made my heart full ü•∫ü•∫

DunkinDonuts,I currently work at Arby's and I'm thinking about working at Dunkin. I'm wondering how stressful it is compared to Arby's. At Arby's there's car after car after car. The longest we go without a car is 10 minutes and that's about two to three times a day. In that time I have to rush to stock and clean. It's usually just a constant rush of cars with no break in between. I'm pushed a lot to be fast ( I have to be done making the food in 30-45 seconds) in order to get a good DT time. I also get no breaks so it's a constant 7+ hours on my feet. I'm pretty sure Dunkin is also under inspire brands so I can imagine there's similar procedure. I'm wondering if someone could give me an idea on how stressful it'll be. I'm getting tired of the gm's constant lash outs about the DT time when I'm the only one on backline most of the time and I'm still expected to help fry station and the running position. We also opened our lobby back up recently so it's 5x worst. I'm trying to leave ASAP but I don't want to go into something more stressful. I can handle the stress and fast paced environment pretty well but some days I just get tired of it all and my gm does not help.,Thinking about working here

Lol. Those were my junior semesters of college and needless to say I gained like 15 pounds at the end of it. So stressful. I haven't had the white chocolate since... but immediately this morning when I smelled my coffee cup I was transported back to my college library, cramming in a tiny cubicle for finals. 

I think this version is less sweet and/or potent than the winter white chocolate I remember. I always got 2 swirls 2 cream in a medium hot and this one tastes much weaker than I remember. Idk, I know the coffee varies so much too. I will definitely be trying it again! I still do get a slight toasted marshmallow smell and flavor. 

The pancakes! I saw y'all bash them a bit but honestly I liked them. A little dry and cold but folded in half and dipped in the syrup they weren't that bad. I tasted maybe a hint of orange or citrus of some kind. Perhaps they were next to the muffins but idk. Lol. I thought they were on par with other fast food pancake options.

Now, on to the pancakes. I got mines and they were cold. I tried them without syrup. They weren't overly sweet, which was good. Despite being cold, they weren't dry. I was prepared for them to be the same consistency of the cake donuts. Lol but the syrup with the pancakes were quite enjoyable, especially with the coffee. The only thing slightly negative I'd say is that the pancakes don't fit into the syrup packet. Most people eat these on the go and won't be placing these on plates and pouring syrup on them. I had to rip them in half to dunk them. So either make the syrup container rounder or make the pancake sticks.

DunkinDonuts,"I'm having nothing but issues with Dunkin's iced coffees lately. It doesn't taste like they add any swirls at all anymore.

The french vanilla one used to be sufficient to give the drink a creamy, sweet flavor without any added cream or sugar, but the last one I had tasted like coffee with ice and nothing more which was a real disappointment since the location I got it from is usually really good about making great tasting drinks. 

I contacted corporate and they just threw 200 points in my account and didn't acknowledge my complaint about the inconsistency of their drinks across locations, or even based on what time you visit or who makes the coffee (I've observed some employees not even putting full pumps of the swirls in my cup even though all my locations have starting charging extra for additional pumps).

It took me awhile to place it, but I swear it tastes like gingerbread which is odd because I don't even see that as a flavor option. What is going on?

This might spell the end for me with Dunkin. I haven't had a truly satisfying iced coffee from them in awhile and it only seems to be getting worse. Might have to go to \*gasp\* Starbucks or just start making my own iced coffees.",Terrible Iced Coffees Lately

DunkinDonuts,"I've been working at dunkin for a few months now and explicitly told the manager I didn't want to be a closer because I don't like being left alone to work by myself. Our store doesn't have a drive-thru but we do take mobile orders, uber eats, and doordash orders. However, the store closes at 9pm. On weekdays, one person stays to help the closer and leaves at 6 or 7pm, leaving the closer by themselves from then until 9pm. On Sundays, the person helping the closer leaves at 5pm (before the recently new manager, this was 4pm) and the closer must take customers, perform any and all cleaning and stocking, and any closing tasks, all while still getting mobile orders, by themselves. The last manager asked if I could close sundays until he could hire someone to close 3 days a week because we were understaffed, so I agreed to do it for a few weeks. Fast forward a little over a month and a half and I'm still closing sundays, being left alone from 5-9. Its hella stressful when you've got mobile orders for food and drinks at 7pm and a line of people in the store, ordering a bunch of shit. Anytime I tell people I'm by closing the store by myself, they're suprised they dont have more than one person doing it. Dunkin's reasoning is that sunday is the slowest day for our store, or they dont have money in the budget to schedule more people (min. wage at my store is $15). I wanted to know if this is normal or if the owners are just exploiting workers to pay the mininum and make the most",One person closing

DunkinDonuts,"Hello Dunkin workers, I have a question for you. Last week I was getting a medium midnight roast every day - I love the taste and it's less acidic than the normal blend. Reminds me of a nice dark moka pot coffee. 

Anyway, this week, two days in a row I have gotten home and it tastes like they are just giving me the normal blend, which I don't like. 

Today I went back and told them that two days now it tastes like I'm being given the normal roast, because it tastes nothing like last week.  Ive worked retail before, so I wasn't Karening them, just stating that it tastes nothing like what I had all last week. 

I appreciate that they gave me a new drink, but as expected, they were being passive aggressive/accusatory with how the original drink was definitely midnight.  

Just for note, I brew with a French press, pour over, aero press, moka pot, and even a manual espresso machine at home - so it's pretty obvious to me when I'm given the wrong coffee. And the difference between normal roast and midnight is night and day (hehe..)

My question, any they likely just giving me normal blend because they don't want to brew midnight, or is there a way they are just not brewing it right?  If they don't feel like brewing it, I don't care, just tell me you're out and don't make me waste my time and money.

DunkinDonuts,"Hello, and good morning! I just wanted to share my experiences with Dunkin. I have been getting a coffee every morning for the past 4-5 months. My addiction first began when I went to buy my office 2 dozen donuts. I smelled this chocolate drink, which the person who ordered it wasn't happy about, but anyway after that I decided to buy one myself. Its called the CochaMocha, I bought one and LOVED it. I started getting one every morning during the week. But I've noticed that 3-4 times out of 10 my order is wrong. Sometimes they don't add the foam, sometimes, they make it iced instead of hot, and sometimes I don't even know what they do wrong. 
Its expensive getting coffee every morning, and I've started making my own recipe at home.(I use dark chocolate, swiss chocolate mix, instant espress, and attempt to froth my own whole milk. Its not bad at all!) All I need to do is buy a latte machine, and then I can say goodbye to dunkin. 
Most issues with my order are that it tastes nothing like a CochaMocha, and when I try to bring up the issues with the Staff they are very rude. They get an attitude. I walk up and say ""I'm sorry, I ordered a CochaMocha, but this doesn't taste like it."" I try my best to be polite but they always get cold with me. Its to the point where i don't want to bother them. I don't want anyone spitting in my drink. I had one lady give me the finger because instead of fixing my drink she just added whipcream and I came back after work to see if someone else could fix it. 
Getting the wrong order can really screw up your morning. I need the extra caffeine. I work with dementia patients so I need all the energy i can get! A wrong order happened again today, so that is why I am writing this. Does anyone else have a similar experience to me? Any advice? Thank you for taking the time to read this, have a nice day! :)

DunkinDonuts,"We‚Äôve got 2 Dunkins in our town, one is about 15 min from me and been around forever, other one is 5 min away and on my way to work, but it‚Äôs newer (by comparison, still been there 2-3 years) and just‚Ä¶ god awful. I‚Äôve given them chance after chance to redeem themselves but today was just my final straw and I absolutely will never go back there. 

Like it‚Äôs so bad, that I really feel like it needs to be reported to corporate or someone above local management. I ordered my coffee at 7:01 this morning and did not receive it until 7:25, I can‚Äôt even flag anyone down to ask bc all the workers keep their heads down and ignore anyone that walks in to pick up. Not the first time I have experienced this either. Actually, it‚Äôs more often than not. Drive in takes roughly 20 minutes to get through and backs up 3 cars deep into the main road. I get that short staffing is a problem a lot of places but, literally have never had an issue at the Dunkin‚Äô on the other side of town. 

Apart from sharing our experience in the app and hoping someone gets back to us, is there a number to call? Honestly, I feel like this location needs some sort of audit done. I would be embarrassed to run a business in the manner it‚Äôs currently operating at. I worked as a barista for a year in 2017. I know it‚Äôs stressful and workers are over worked and underpaid. But this location has really painted Dunkin‚Äô in a bad light for me and I‚Äôm sure plenty of others in our town. My dad doesn‚Äôt go to that location any more for the same reason. 

Part rant here, part I really do feel like this should be reported higher up and wondering if anyone else has done something similar.",Local Dunkin‚Äô is just a nightmare

Then today I go to a different location, and ordered on mobile. They gave me cream cheese on the side... in a small coffee cup with a lid! 

Personally I really don't care how I get my cream cheese. But I'm wondering if something changed behind the scenes, do some locations not have little things of it anymore and only have like a big tub?

DunkinDonuts,"Im an assistant manager at the location i work at. It's me, the store manager, &amp; we only have 1 shift lead atm. I get along pretty well with the store manager but definitely have my thoughts about her..

First-- i work way more hrs than she does, fine whatever. She also consistently comes in 5/10min late everyday (7am.) She never opens &amp; im the main opener, which i dont mind cuz im a morning person anyways &amp; i get out early. 

Theres been MULTIPLE times where everyone (usually 1 or 2 other people) dont show up to open with me &amp; im completely by myself. I make this known in our group chat app, where i see that she sees it but never replies &amp; still comes in at her scheduled time-- which i feel like if ur the STORE MANAGER it should be ur responsibility to step up if you know someone is literally alone at the store working.. 

Yesterday i was due in at 5am &amp; she was surprisingly there at 4:30am opening by herself (usually i do that) &amp; i was standing at the back door about to walk in when it hit 5:01am &amp; shes already sending me txts asking me where im at &amp; also posting in the group chat. This is from the SAME woman whose left me alone to run the entire store 3 times &amp; seemed to not give af but ofc when shes alone for 1 fuckin min shes blowing my shit up.. Ive gone 3hrs with no help before (granted i DID have to tell people that I couldn't make food atm since it was impossible.)

She also disappears to do paperwork/money, etc.. in the office &amp; is gone off the floor at peak rush times, even when theres only 3 of us at a time. I have noticed shes gotten better with this lately tho (thank God) but she then chooses to go run to the bank at the very last minute before a shift change. As an assistant i cannot leave if shes gone at the bank before a shift change cuz i need to stay &amp; make sure everyone whos due to work shows up. I get that but there's been times where regular crew members also can't leave cuz the person relieving them is late &amp; shes gone at the bank. 

Im just so fuckin annoyed by her &amp; her ""rules for thee but not for me"" attitude. Sorry i just had to get that off my chest. Feel free to leave ur own horror stories! All employees of dunkin should seriously hold a convention to collectively get together &amp; bitch about shit like this.",Just a rant about my manager (rant with me!)

Although Friday‚Äôs, Saturdays and Sundays we have 3-5 people and they expect us to have great drive thru times and balance the front counter which feels almost impossible. We‚Äôve tried to keep the front closed so we can focus on one instead of juggling both but upper management gets pissy. I said if they want us to do both we need more people here.

DunkinDonuts,I usually like going to this Dunkin because the regular guy working there. Is usually different from most Dunkin employees. Really friendly and cool with everyone. Even with all the junkies and crazies out front the door. I messed up because I usually pay before hand. But I decided to pay in store today. And it was  a different worker this time. I had him scan my app but the register said I still owed 19 cents. So I said alright I'll pay the rest with my card. I go to check my account later and this fool took the $3.41 from my app and then went charged me $3 and the 19 cents I owe. It's not that the dude is scamming me but it was more obvious that's he's just straight slow and dumb. Next time I'll just remember to pay before hand.,I just got charged twice because of an idiot employee

DunkinDonuts,"Anyone else have this happen?

https://freeimage.host/i/5dozqN

In the app I ordered a $2 coffee and a $1.25 pack of munchkins. No extra charges outlined and the subtotal rings up as $3.85. With tax it's $4.14. How does $2 + $1.25 = $3.85?

The subtotal is never correct no matter what I order. I've reinstalled the app. I've tried on my husband's phone with a new username. It's not a big deal monetarily speaking, however it is kind of odd. There is no explanation for the subtotal. I understand there are upcharges for certain things, such as cold foam, but the app outlines them clearly and correctly adds them to the subtotal.

For comparison here is the receipt from the same store but ordering in person. Same order. Subtotal is $3.25 like it should be.

https://freeimage.host/i/5doR7n

Then he ordered a jelly donut and his girlfriend goes, ""a jelly donut? are you insane? I never knew you liked them"" In a joking way and I laughed a little too before giving him his donut. She ordered a Latte with extra caramel and that was it.
Minutes later, I was fixing the donut cases when she came back in, asking for 3 MORE shots of espresso. She said ""There's nothing wrong with the drink it's just that he likes his coffee really bitter and disgusting."" And i laughed saying, ""I mean no harm but when he said three more shots of espresso I was surprised"" and she replied, ""No yeah I saw it on your face when he said it"" So we give her three shots of espresso free of charge in a separate cup and she comes back in a minute or so later, gave us a thumbs up and said, ""I just wanted to say he said it was PERFECT!"" and we all laughed before she left.

DunkinDonuts,"I'm totally fine with the menu listing the 50 cent upcharge for me to get oat or almond milk. But I  went to one Dunks recently where I came to the window &amp; my coffee was $7 (large iced w/ oat milk &amp; a turbo shot). The guy told me that it was 50 cents for oat milk, and they do 4 milks in a large, so it was an extra $2. That didn't sound right to me. 

A different location told me that they'd only list 1 oat milk on the order &amp; put the regular amount in so I didn't get charged for each one. Are they just ringing this in wrong? Is it standard for the charge to be per milk serving? I haven't had this issue at other locations.",Charges for non-dairy milk?

 When I asked about it, the employee said ""taxes are crazy"" I said ""it's not taxes, its ringing up the wrong price"" and she said the menu was wrong. Didn't try to fix it or anything, just stared at me and told me the register prices dont match the menu. That's theft in my mind.

This is the second time this has happened in the last month. The first time, the advertised price was only if you purchased through the app, fine print. Again, staff was totally apathetic. The drink was nasty too and they didnt offer to remake it, just stared at us hoping we would leave.

DunkinDonuts,"I don't know about other Dunkin locations, I only have 1 in my town but any free drink I'm convinced the manager tells the employees free drinks get no coffee or swirl in them. They have that free Monday coffee and i only got it a few times because I've had to dump all of them except 1 and it wasn't because it was good, it just actually had coffee in it, bad coffee but still coffee. Same with all my reward drinks I think I've pretty much trashed almost all of them because they were undrinkable and if I did manage to drink one it was never the standard quality. 

Not that paying for drinks is much better. This location will almost never put a full amount of swirl in most drinks and there is no way employees don't know to put 3 swirls in the medium when its right there on the sticker and it's been so consistently like this for a long time that I just accept it and enjoy the flavor of the coffee instead. I usually get the cold brew which had been consistently good since it came out but has gotten weaker recently nut was still good enough to drink until they straight up gave a cup of water last time with, of course, no swirl. I don't know how they got it to turn brown when I could literally taste the flavor of the water.

My point is don't be lured in by free drink rewards and offers and waste money like I did. I wish they wouldn't even have them maybe they don't have enough product to keep up with offering free drinks. I was going to stop going a while ago but I get hooked back in when they come out with a new drink and I know if I go the first day or week it comes out they will make it properly and it's really delicious and I like the seasonal flavors they come out with that I can't make at home. Which is why I need them to stop these phoney promotions and just have customers pay enough for the store to make a drink properly. 

I have written feedback through the app months ago about this problem and nothing ever changed. Last time I did receive a receipt, I think maybe by accident since it was wet and stuck to the cup but I realized that was the first time I ever got a receipt from them and they have a survey on it, now I know why I've never been asked or given a receipt.

DunkinDonuts,"I normally don‚Äôt order donuts because it‚Äôs rare that they have the one I want, but I‚Äôve had a really rough week and wanted to treat myself. I figured I‚Äôd order the apple crumb donut, it‚Äôs my favorite, and to me it‚Äôs a fall flavor despite being all year round so I thought it would be a safe bet. I always have at least two back ups in my mind. So I get there and they don‚Äôt have apple crumb, so I ask for apple cider fully expecting it to be out but still wishful thinking. They say that‚Äôs out. So then I ask for blueberry, and they say they don‚Äôt make blueberry during pumpkin season. So finally I just asked them to surprise me with whatever and they ended up finding an apple cider donut. I go to Starbucks pretty regularly and the app always says what food &amp; drinks the location you are ordering from is out of. I feel bad for the Dunkin employees because they have to go through the hassle of trying to explain that they don‚Äôt have what someone ordered and then get something new. And I feel bad for us customers who get our hopes up. Especially because sometimes I‚Äôve ordered something that can‚Äôt be replaced as easily,
like a sandwich, and my local Dunkin always tried to claim they can‚Äôt refund me even tho it‚Äôs a product I didn‚Äôt receive. Every donut I tried was listed on the app, so if blueberry isn‚Äôt sold in fall, wouldn‚Äôt it be easier for everyone if the app didn‚Äôt list it? Also I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs people who are not nice about their donut being sold out and don‚Äôt come with backup ideas so that‚Äôs unfair to the employees as well.

DunkinDonuts,"I'm normally one of those basic brats that orders super custom drinks from Starbucks, but I always order in their app so I'm not an obnoxious customer at the drive thru. Except recently, I've noticed my stomach is not happy with the Bucks, and their pumpkin spice items are garbage again this year. 

Enter Dunkin .... My sister said the pumpkin cold brew was really good compared to the Bucks, so I went and tried it. I definitely preferred it as far as taste goes, but here is my conundrum. 

Part of the reason I switched to Starbucks so long ago is because I can literally customize every part of my drink on their app. Dunkin's app is very limited in comparison, and customizing a drink seems almost forbidden. I can't add more vanilla to the pumpkin cold brew. I can't ask for extra foam. Trying to figure out how many extra pumps of this or that to make it not taste watered down is like trying to solve some ridiculous trigonometry math problem.

DunkinDonuts,"So today was a first for me. Today at around 5:45/6pm Eastern time my fianc√© and I went through our usual Dunkin drive thru and as we pull up there is a dude just standing at the drive thru order screen - not in a vehicle of any kind. He was looking at the menu but it didn't look like he was talking to the barista. After a few seconds he acknowledges us and looks like he's saying something so I rolled the window down and asked what he said. He asks me if I could pull up further because ""they don't see me out here so they don't know I'm here trying to order"". So I told him I didn't think they would serve him on foot at the drive thru. He said he couldn't go in because the lobby was closed and he couldn't fit his car in the drive thru. He points to his gigantic truck that he's towing another truck on top of. So then the barista tells him he can't be in the drive thru without a vehicle and they weren't going to be taking his order like that. Well after he goes back and forth with her for a minute he finally walks off. So we pull up, order and then pull up to the window. While we were waiting for our order the barista apologized for what happened and I said it was fine and that I even told the guy they probably wouldn't serve him. So she goes ""He did the same thing yesterday and we told him he couldn't!!"" 

Then another barista goes ""Omg he's pulling that huge truck into the drive thru!!"" And sure enough this dude is trying to fit his behemoth vehicle into this tight little drive thru that has a pretty narrow, sharp turn on it to get to the window. And we were all saying the same thing - he's never gonna be able to make that turn!! We were laughing so I told the girl at the window that we would probably be back through tomorrow and was hoping to get an update on how the situation turned out. He was getting stuck and it looked like he got hung up on the curb as I was pulling away. I have no idea if he made the turn or not, how long it took if he did, or if he damaged their building in any way. I am so curious to find out haha I couldn't believe that! Dude must have really wanted some Dunkin bad!!","Pittsburgh, PA Pleasant Hills Dunkin &amp; the Guy on Foot in the Drive Thru"
DunkinDonuts,"I just got a team member job at a local Dunkin. This is my first food service job; previously I've worked office jobs. I took this job because I wanted to try something different. I'm especially interested in getting experience as a barista.

I've worked there ten days and I'm getting more and more frustrated. On my first day, they stuck me at the drive thru window, and that's almost all I've done since. I've learned how to make a few drinks by osmosis. I've also taught myself to use the POS order entry system at the front desk. But the only thing I've received training on is drive thru. And it's incredibly frustrating because not only have I not been trained on anything since Day 1, it's like I'm also being discouraged from doing and learning new things. When I try to step up when we're ten orders behind and there's a twenty-minute queue, I'm told to go back to the drive thru and twiddle my thumbs on the off-chance the customer needs something. When it's slow and I ask my coworkers and shift leads whether there's anything I can help out with or be trained on, I'm told to just worry about drive thru. And the GM, despite telling me when I was hired that I'd be getting a ""real"" training in the first few days of work, still hasn't followed through on that. On the contrary, it's more of the same when I approach him directly: stay at the drive thru window. I don't understand and feel resentful because A) It's not like I can't handle more. I get drive thru. It's easy. B) It's not like I'm not a good worker in general. I finish all of my tasks, I take initiative to learn new things and solve problems I run into independently, and I come in on time or early and often stay late to help out. Sometimes VERY late. C) Everyone else was trained to do everything starting on their first day. People who started working there only a few days ahead of me were trained to work multiple stations and get to float around doing different jobs. I'm the only exception. Wtf. 

In general, I'm not impressed with management. My GM is a nice guy and he works hard, but he's not very organized or communicative. Much like I haven't been trained on many work tasks, I've also had to follow up with him multiple times on various administrative things: onboarding paperwork, what my pay actually is, whether he's looking for part time or full time employment with me, how to check my schedule (I actually learned through a coworker about our location's GroupMe chat where this info is posted. It then took my GM multiple tries to successfully invite me, even with me standing next to him and giving him my phone #), how to clock in and out, getting tips (which he's been late on once already), etc. He still hasn't sent me the rest of the training videos I'm supposed to do. In addition, we are chronically understaffed, which leads to extremely long wait times for our customers and lots of stress on my coworkers. (And again, despite this, apparently they don't want me to help out when there's a backlog?? I don't understand.)

Is this normal? I'm seriously considering jumping ship already, but at the same time it's only been ten days and maybe it will get better...?",Getting frustrated as a new hire - is this normal?

DunkinDonuts,"At this time of year, basically the only drinks I enjoy are Pumpkin Swirl cold brew, PS latte/macchiato/cappuccino (light ice, 2-3 swirls and no sugar). Caramel Swirl is also good. The trouble is I'm getting a little tired of the same order. I want to mix things up. What are some good combinations? I saw someone suggest 1 caramel and 2 vanilla swirls to get a smoked vanilla flavor. 

What other good combinations are there? What about the coffee/vanilla bean syrups they use in the frozen coffees? Or caramel + pumpkin? How many pumps should I get, how much cream?

Alright, here is what happened to me last night, I was closing with the person I had closed with before and it didn‚Äôt go so well, I was hoping this time it would be different but I was sooo wrong! 

I took the donuts off the case and placed them on the rack and when I went to push over to drive thru she says no leave them over and I said to her I close the store my way and you close it your way, but I left them there over by the case and walked away grabbed my phone to send a message to one of the shift leaders about it! Anyway after I came back inside I never said another word to her, she just flipped out and started going on and on that I (demanding part comes in) should respect ‚Äúher‚Äù and since I wasn‚Äôt talking to her it‚Äôs a sign of disrespect, that came after I went to get a blue rag to clean the tables in the lobby she asked ‚Äúwhere was I going?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond she could‚Äôve easily seen where I was going! That‚Äôs when she decides that she is going to walk out and say to me ‚Äúsince you know what to do, you can do it!‚Äù I lock the door and sit my mop down and take care of the customers she left in drive thru!

I am a regular at Dunkin' Donuts here in my home state of North Caroline. I was hoping someone would know or have an idea if Dunkin' is increasing their prices on iced coffees? My regular order 99% of the time is a Medium iced  coffee with a flavor in it (either French vanilla or caramel) a few years back my total after tax was $2.44, then recently it has been $2.88 and now the last few times I have been (which caught be by surprise) was $3.45.

DunkinDonuts,"Hi folks. Been going to Dunkin almost daily for years now, and I've had a couple of issues and I'm curious if any workers or patrons have any answers.

I usually get the 2 for $2 egg and cheese wake up wraps if I'm hungry. Recently, two of my local Dunkin spots must have made anything with cheese extra. One location charges $1.20 for a slice of cheese and another location 55 cents. So the 2 for $2 turns into 2 for $4.40 because its the $2 plus the $1.20 for each cheese. It makes absolutely no sense. Is this a store decision or is it maybe a glitch in the system?

Similarly, I used to have the cost of almond/oat milk covered in my free drink coupons but now I have to pay for that.

There are other locations (I'm in NYC btw) that I haven't had this issue with, but the two closest to my apartment are doing this and now I don't want to order food to pay that much.

DunkinDonuts,"Hi all,  


Is it bad etiquette to submit a mobile order while waiting in line at the drive thru?  


Let met explain by sharing my recent experience.   


This morning, I submitted a mobile order (two lattes and half a dozen donuts) while waiting in line at the drive thru. This location was not busy, but I typically do this for a few reasons, and I thought it was more convenient on both sides. I was even under the impression that the drive thru mobile orders were not prepared until you reached the speaker regardless.  


Anyways, a moment later I reach the speaker and say that I just submitted an online order. The employee was clearly frustrated and said that I can't just submit an order and immediately pick up at the drive thru. And that I need to give time for the order to be prepared. I tried to explain that I was not expecting the order to already be prepared, but I doubt I made that point clear. Sensing further frustration,  I tried to just cancel the order but they said it was too late, it was already started. I relented, said thanks, and when I reached the pickup window I was greeted by a friendlier employee and the order was immediately ready.  


What happened?   


I think the first employee was having an off day, but it raises the question, is placing a mobile order while waiting in the drive thru bad etiquette?   


I do this frequently, albeit at a different location, without issue. But maybe this was the first time an employee was willing to share this feedback. Should I just wait until I reach the speaker to place an order?  


I would greatly appreciate an outside perspective.

DunkinDonuts,"Hope this is OK to post there - but as a fellow Dunkin' frequenter thought I'd share how I save some $$ on my daily purchases..

I use this app ""Fluz"" --&gt;  [https://joinfluz.app.link/OSULLIVAN28497A66](https://joinfluz.app.link/OSULLIVAN28497A66) mainly for the benefit of generating credit card points through gift card purchases, but that's another topic :)

Where it comes in handy for DUNKIN is that they have a select few stores (including DUNKIN) that give you back 35% in savings when you purchase a gift card through them ($3.5 max each voucher). So I purchase a Dunkin card for $10 and the app awards me back $3.5 for that purchase. 

You get $5 in rewards when you sign up I believe, 3 free vouchers to start with when you use the above link to sign up +3 other free ones every month, just by making posts on their community message boards. So all in all, it's pretty easy to get at least a few of these monthly for savings over time..

At the risk of sounding like a robot/salesman, I'll stop here! But the app is a pretty cool source of savings if you're into that kind of min/maxing stuff - feel free to PM me for more info, if needed.

Hope someone is able to find this useful, enjoy!",Little tip for big Dunkin' Savings :)

No, we generally will not give you free dozens when we‚Äôre about to close. We don‚Äôt care if you know they get thrown away. 

Try and pretend you think we‚Äôre human beings. It‚Äôs very annoying to smile and say ‚Äúhey how are you today ‚Äú only to get ‚Äúmedium coffee with cream‚Äù in return. 

Don‚Äôt place an order at drive through and then decide you don‚Äôt want it and leave. We‚Äôve made it. You‚Äôre being wasteful. 

Allow at least five minutes after placing a mobile order before you arrive. Anyone who works at Dunkin will agree, it‚Äôs very annoying to have someone at the speaker saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to place a mobile order ‚Äú it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúOn The Go and not ‚ÄúSitting for 5 minutes in the drive through ‚Äú for a reason.",Few things for customers to understand.

DunkinDonuts,"Here's how the game works if you haven't played it yet via Dunkin Carnival (dunkincarnival.com).

There's three rows of Dunkin products attached to balloons, you pick any from numbered #1 to 3 and mash a button that sprays a water gun and fills up the balloon. You battle against bot players that will fill the opposing balloons. First balloon to fill up and pop the balloon wins.

But the problem is, the balloon pops at random chance, not how much effort you put into the game. Truth be told, the game already selects if you're a winner or not. If you're selected as a loser, it doesn't matter if you mash your mouse or tap your screen to hell, the balloon will lock at it's fullest state and not pop, leaving the other bot players to win.

But if you don't play hard enough it seems like you lost because you didn't put in enough effort, which is also false.

In my opinion the interactive 'gameplay' element should be removed before it causes frustration. You should pick a number, click it, then it plays an animation of you filling up the balloon and the other bot players beating you if you lose, the balloon popping first if you win. Not you mashing buttons to see that the balloon refuses to pop no matter what and seeing a big ""haha, that effort was for nothing, take the L, loser"" in your face.","Dunkin's latest Carnival game on the site, Balloon Pop, is very misleading and can be potentially upsetting"

I told the employee that I had been behind the truck, but she just repeated that I should go through the regular lane when there's no cars.

DunkinDonuts,"Let me preface by saying i hate working here haha but I needed money and this job was the only one available that worked with my schedule. Having said that, my feelings are going to be biased negatively. 

Recently we had a health inspector come and basically tell management that everything is wrong. And it is. No labels anywhere, sinks are gross, the drain pipes are barely cleaned and our AC is busted so it's unsavory work conditions. My managers also like to fuck off at 11am when the rush is over so they weren't present when the inspector came which was noted. 

My management is also notorious for shorting everyone their hours and not paying what people have worked. They also like to change prices on the menu frequently and blame it on corporate when other Dunkin location prices in the area are cheaper (is a large iced latte supposed to be $6?). They're also so obsessed with the timer and pull up all the cars making workers run out with orders but no one to stay inside to make quick coffees. I want to tell all the customers that come to this location, especially the regulars, that this Dunkin is no good and their money is better spent somewhere else. 

They also like to never make the sunrise and midnight hot coffees and instead just put an espresso shot to ""cut costs"". When they leave my coworkers and I will always make fresh batches of both. None of what they do makes sense to me and I'm looking forward to the day they get shut down.

DunkinDonuts,"i‚Äôve been working at dunkin for over a month now and i‚Äôm starting to hate waking up everyday, facing the fact that i have work. i‚Äôm so sick of making coffee and most importantly dealing with customers. today our manager purposely scheduled minimal people, because he assumed it wouldn‚Äôt be busy today. he was wrong. we were slammed, and i was stressing out bc i was the only one making coffee. i ended up getting a migraine and felt nauseous. i had a couple of bad customer experiences today, but one just set me off. a lady was doing a favor order, and a new employee took her order, and mistakingly added extra bacon and cheese to a wrap, which was $2 extra. she brought this to my attention, and i told her we could not refund her order, and that we could make her another one. she ended up buying another, and got mad that it didn‚Äôt come out the same time as the other. i explained to her since she ordered one later, it will come out later. she asked for my name, and i felt uncomfortable to tell her. i offered to get my manager, but then she just stormed out. im 17, and ive never had a job this stressful with hands down the rudest customers i‚Äôve ever dealt with. is it too early to say i dislike the job? am i doing something wrong?",am i doing everything wrong

DunkinDonuts,"So I just went into a store for an order and I noticed the menu board now describes what was the blueberry pomegranate as ""purple pomegranate"". They had it listed for both the regular one and the coconut milk one.

So, two questions I guess. I started asking if the purple pomegranate was the same as the blueberry pom, but she stopped me and said they didn't have any (which I figured as I've been aware of the shortages and have been making the blueberry pom at home). I *think* she may have said that they were discontinued though? It was pretty loud and we're separated by a piece of plexiglass still too so I wasn't positive that was what she said, and I didn't want to waste any more of her time because the drive thru was slammed.

First Question is Almond Breeze and Silk are the brands as far as I know,  are they sweetened? 

I am looking at the nutritional information on that Dunkin releases and I can see the following:

Large Iced Coffee with Coconut Milk is 20 calories and 1 total carbs - this would lead me to believe that the Coconut Milk is not sweetened.

Large Hot Coffee with Almond Milk is 35 Calories and 5 total carbs with 5 grams of added sugar. (Sweetened maybe)? Calories a little low for the sweetened version but that maybe the amount of almond milk used.

Large Vanilla Iced Macchiato with Almond Milk is 100 calories 16 total carbs with 13 added sugar. This speaks that the Vanilla Almond Milk is Sweetened or there is sweet vanilla syrup added.

Business is booming and the late morning small lull is no longer with school on summer vacation. So basically it‚Äôs balls to walls all shift.

Anyway day goes by only a few questions as to why it‚Äôs turned off from our regulars. We always say we don‚Äôt  know we can‚Äôt control the app. Usually the regulars have seem be fine with it and most of our regulars understanding of the staff shortages and most assume that‚Äôs why.

DunkinDonuts,"Hi first time poster here, I work at a Dunkin in Maine and unfortunately I was diagnosed with strep throat yesterday night.

I have a doctor's note but that's apparently not enough. I'll soon get my bill in the mail but that's not enough. So I was just wondering can they even legally request this?

DunkinDonuts,"After six very long months of working in  a Dunks on a busy street with rude customers, no breaks and no tips, I‚Äôve finally got in with Starbucks. Personally, $170 a week just doesn‚Äôt cut it for me. I‚Äôm about to start college. No benefits or anything, my only benefit would be a discount on donuts but I don‚Äôt even like donuts. I‚Äôm so glad that in two weeks, I‚Äôll never have to see one of my coworkers again. He stressed me out more than anything and was so rude to guests and fellow coworkers, and management would do nothing about it. 

I was very sick for the last (almost) two weeks with a fever, wheezing, nausea, and whilst going to the doctors, I was diagnosed with a multitude of different things I had no idea about, like scoliosis and asthma (explains my soreness and tiredness after working a shift with no breaks at Dunkin‚Äô.) AND I TOLD THEM THIS AND THEY STILL WANTED ME TO COME IN. WITH A FEVER. AND A COUGH. DURING A PANDEMIC.

DunkinDonuts,"Placed my DCP order this week and saw that Croissant Stuffers have been discontinued--both varieties--despite being featured all over the Drive-Thru menu board and other promotional images in the store. WTF.

DunkinDonuts,Since Saturday it seems that all the Dunkin locations in eastern and central Connecticut are out of all refresher and tea flavors. Noticed the post below regarding ‚Äúwhite stuff‚Äù floating in them‚Äîis there an issue? What‚Äôs up?,Missing Refreshers
DunkinDonuts,A lot of drinks I usually order like say the Iced Chai or Matcha. There's usually either Matcha stuck to the bottom or  syrup that hadn't been mixed in right. And it usually messes up the completeness of the drink. I had to try Starbucks versions to see if this is just a common thing. And come to find out it's really just a Dunkin thing. Because I just bought an Iced Chai form Starbucks and had a Matcha the other day. And no remnants of syrup or anything at the bottom. Just perfectly mixed and blended. Doesn't Starbucks use things like syrup and power as well?,Why are Starbucks drinks more blended properly compare to Dunkin?
DunkinDonuts,[removed],smoked taste
DunkinDonuts,The one time I ordered the guy was completely clueless. What makes it worse he probably was the manager too. But he gave me a regular cold foam with no smoke vanilla syrup. The other time I ordered from a different place but it was just the smoked vanilla iced latte. And that time I got to taste what the smoked vanilla actually tasted like and it was enjoyable. But I'm going to try a different location because that first spot I go to the guy always messes up most of the time. And it's not even no point in telling him to make it over. Because he doesn't even know the new drinks. And it stressed me out trying to explain something he should already know. But it's supposed to the powder sprinkle on top as well right?,For the Smoke Vanilla with cold cream. Are they suppose to sprinkle some powder on top? Like they have in the photos

Help!!!,Low calorie cold brew ideas?
DunkinDonuts,"\*Disclaimer: I can only speak for my store, and anything I will say is not necessarily representative of other stores\*

My store has a drive thru, and just about every day there is always a mad rush within the last 10 minutes before we close, with the line spilling out onto the street. Our store works best when there are 4 or 5 crewmembers working the closing shift, though due to staffing shortages we have been running on 3 people (the bare minimum: 1 person each on Drive thru order/register, beverages, sandwich). Because we have 2 stations, Drive thru and the walk-in/front lobby, we have two stations to clean up and it is a lot of work for 3 people. About 30 minutes before closing we begin to discard most of our stock, so we usually only have enough coffee (both hot and iced),as well as iced and green tea for 4 or 5 larges of each. We have also begun the process of closing down by then, and all of the machines are fully stocked and cleaned. It is difficult and annoying to have to set something up for one customer, only to take it down again. If we don't do this, we are stuck cleaning for well over an hour after closing which nobody wants to do after 9-10 hour shifts. Unless all you're getting is a simple drink or two, please make every effort to come in earlier. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr:

Please make every effort to not order within the last half hour of closing of any DD store, because it disrupts the closing process, and our inventory/stock is more limited by then. Come in earlier, and it will be easier for us to fulfill any orders which benefits both the customer and crew.  For example, if a store closes at 8pm, try to order by 7:30. We really appreciate it :)","PSA: please please make every effort not to order within the last hour, come in earlier if possible"

DunkinDonuts,"This job isn't easy, mentally and physically. Getting yelled at by management over basically nothing is NOT normal, so don't think any of it is your fault. As for the customers, they're the hardest part in my opinion. It's been the norm to give the service industry a hard time and I wish I could change that. Maybe if more than half of them gave even a smile it would change our work lives. I've been working at Dunkin for almost two years now.

It tastes like those homemade edible cookie dough bites or those candy cookie dough bites in theaters and groceries. In my opinion, it's not going to top Butter Pecan for me BUT it is very nice and refreshing to have. I do like mixing things up so I won't get sick of BP and this swirl will do nicely.

It's seems pretty mildly flavored for a swirl. The flavor of espresso greatly compliments but fights the cookie dough flavor, I'd prefer it but I may consider a pump extra. While with weaker coffee such as brew (iced/hot), the cookie dough flavor should be more obvious. Even then, try it with regular pumps and see if you want a pump extra.",Cookie Dough Swirl thoughts

DunkinDonuts,,What‚Äôs the secret?
DunkinDonuts,,New offer coming tomorrow FYI :)
DunkinDonuts,"Hi guys, I'm a new employee at Dunkin' Donuts (started last Monday) Before DD, I worked at a locally owned cafe shop where I received professional barista training and I also worked at Starbucks, so needless to say I'm pretty familiar with making espresso drinks. I started working at DD for a summer job and because it was within walking distance to where I live.

Starbucks has a very specific system when it comes to making espresso drinks, the shots are pulled to order. The tall gets one shot, and the grande and venti get two shots unless the customer asked for extra. Then, add the syrups and then fill the milk or water. If it is an iced drink, they fill the milk to the line indicated on the cup, and then the rest is filled with ice, it's a pretty easy, straightforward system to learn.

However, at DD, there seems to be no rhythm or reason to how these drinks are made. My manager fills a pitcher full of espresso shots and just leaves it sitting there all day, which in my opinion, is gross. Nobody has any clue how many shots each drink is supposed to be getting and I witness my managers putting an ENORMOUS amount of espresso in drinks all the time. It honestly makes me worry about the customer's health. I also noticed at DD, the iced cups have lines and numbers inside of them as well, which leads me to believe that they are supposed to be made in a manner similar to Starbucks where the ice is added last, but if I don't add the ice first, the manager gets ticked. I don't understand adding the ice first at all, when you are pouring the iced coffee, tea, etc all it does is bounce off the ice and make a huge mess. The syrups cannot get mixed correctly like this either

Nobody here understands the art of steaming milk correctly. Listening to the steam pitcher make that horrible ringing sound is the worst thing in the world. None of my coworkers seem to get that the milk steamer should NOT be making that sound and when I say anything about it all I get is ""well that's how it is.""

So please tell me is this normal?? Because I really feel like it isn't. Anytime I ask questions about this all I get is ""Well, this is how I was trained.""",Is this normal? Or is the store I am working at just weird? (Espresso drinks)

DunkinDonuts,I swear today was over the top nonsense. Had folks trying to order well before we open like 15 mins and then banging on FD when we didn‚Äôt answer the DT. Neither of us had our headsets on yet. We didn‚Äôt serve them cause they were rude plus the banging on door. Scared us half to death. One kicked the door leaving. Later lady asked me to tell her all the donuts we have and I tell her and she orders one glazed! Then another which happens all the time start spouting out the donuts and I ask her to please give me a moment to get boxes for her four dozen! She yells through no she in hurry! I tell her I‚Äôm sorry but I need to put them in the boxes. She yells again. My manager chimed in told her to please come inside because she also needed two boxes of Joe! One Sunrise. Which we never have more than a few cups because it doesn‚Äôt sell! Well that sent her over the edge. She comes in screaming she has no time for waiting. I told her should could of ordered through app or called ahead. We need time to put together the order. She then gets on her phone and I‚Äôm standing there. She doesn‚Äôt care. I go back to DT and check on her in a few she still on phone. I get the two boxes of Joe now complete she still on phone. Laughing and being human like. I help a customer that came up to the FC. now this woman gets off the phone and yells she was here first! I ignore her finish what I‚Äôm doing.I ask her what donuts she would like and she yells that I haven‚Äôt done that yet? I said no ma‚Äôam you didn‚Äôt tell me which one you want. She proceeds to tell me but she very rude and loud. Our manager comes out as I‚Äôm taking her payment and tells her don‚Äôt come back her again. That started a whole slew of things.

Thus, I was over the moon to hear of the new peach flavor at Dunkin! What could be better - my go to drink place has peach? Sign me up!

Wrong: this peach passion fruit flavor is horrifying. It tastes like a rotten peach got mixed up with those god awful passion fruit Starbursts.

DunkinDonuts,"hopefully this goes through this time.

I started working at my dunkin' a week or two after I turned 18. (I am 19 now so it has been a full year.) I was the youngest worker in the store and honestly, my co-workers treated me differently because of it.

To start off, I applied to work part time, and I told the owner and manager that during my interview. Since I was 18 I was supposed to start college soon. Well some paperwork issues happened with my college and I didnt get to start until almost november. Dunkin' saw this free time I had as an opportunity and scheduled me for MORE than 40 hours a week, for almost a month. However my checks would read 38 or 39 hours and I always assumed I was counting wrong. (turns out they dropped my hours so I wouldn't get benefits since I was technically part-time).

The employees there treated me like a running man. Even though I was trained in every station and could work it effectively, I was never assigned a station in the morning, I was just expected to run around and help any station that was overwhelmed. I was fine with this, until employees would start yelling at me because they needed help and I was somewhere else. One employee in particular expected me to drop everything I was doing the second they called me, even if I was actively talking to a customer.  

Because I was expected to be everywhere at once, I was never allowed to sit down or even lean against the counter. After the rush ended I was expected to stock up or wipe everything meticulously, my manager's signature catchphrase was ""if you got time to lean you got time to clean"" yet you'd always see him leaning/sitting down. I had to use my bathroom breaks to get a chance to lean and take a breather. But that didnt stop anyway from yelling at me from behind the counter to hurry up because people were in line.

I could never use my phone, even if I was in the back with no customers in the lobby. Someone would always say something like ""go stock xyz"" or ""yknow the boss is watching on the cameras"" despite the fact that some employees would actively be on a phone call during the morning rush. I never sat on social media at work either, it was usually to text my parents about when I was getting home and if I needed a ride.

The last time I complained about how I felt disrespected while working there, the manager told me WORD FOR WORD that I was imagining it and ""maybe I had some problems at home that I needed to work on."" Honestly that should've been the biggest red flag but it was my first job and I always told myself that maybe I was being dramatic and all jobs were like this.

Maybe I am still being a bit dramatic, but even if I am I don't care anymore. The job made me feel terrible and theres always others, that will hopefully treat me better.","lets try this again, i quit my dunkin because it was a nightmare"
