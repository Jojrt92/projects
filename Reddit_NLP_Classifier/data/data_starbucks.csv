starbucks,"I have not been a barista for like 4 years or something now so my memory is fuzzy. I have two questions.

  
First: I may have the wrong name for this but the apple steamer? It was steamed apple juice with cinnamon dolce I think and it was heaven in winter. Is this still a drink item? I never notice it on the menu but I don't get hot drinks often. Been craving it lately and before I disappoint myself i wanted to check if this was still in existence. 

Second: Bf's sister tried to order a peppermint mocha recently and was asked by the barista how many pumps of each she wanted. She had never been asked that before so it threw her off, so she did half and half and said it tasted weird. She got a grande.  If I am not mistaken, the peppermint mocha is only technically on-menu during the holidays even though there's always peppermint syrup, so unless a barista has done holidays they might not know the recipe in the off season, is this possibly why? Follow up: Does anyone know what the recipe was last holiday so I can pass it on? Just looking for how many pumps of each if it's a grande.

starbucks,"Starbucks had a pretty positive image in my opinion, until my last visit recently. 

I ordered a coffee using Starbucks app and the app allowed me to pickup in store, the estimated pickup time was 9:21pm. I arrived at the store at 9:18pm and the store front door was closed. I called the store and they told me I could only go to drive through to pickup my drink. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable and safe to walk to the drive through, but unfortunately they were not willing to give my drink from the front door. I asked what if I didn‚Äôt drive, and they just kept repeating my only option was to go to the drive through.

Starbucks could afford it &amp; they should do the right thing to take care of their employees while they decided to remodel their stores. This is their choice to remodel, and the baristas shouldn‚Äôt be put at stake for this kind of thing.

starbucks,"TW!!!! Talk of mental health &amp; suicide 

To make a very long and complicated story short, I slipped on half a mat back in December of 2019 while I was covering a shift and trying to help out another store in our district who for whatever reason cut their safety mats in half... I completely ruptured my ACL, MCL, tore my meniscus and fractured my tibia. I had surgery on them February 26th and immediately knew after surgery that something was not right... My surgeon refused to listened to me and Starbucks denied my request for a second opinion with another surgeon since mine was refusing to order an MRI I begged, pleaded, and even cried for him to please order. Come June, my patella completely snapped in half on me 5 days after I saw my surgeon at my last post op appointment where I ended up leaving his office in tears having a panic attack and suicidal due to his rudeness, not listening, not caring, laughing at me and calling me a whimp and gaslighting me.. All of this, plus being out of work so long has caused a downward spiral in my mental health. I attempted suicide on December 13th and have been in treatment off and on since.. I found out that my short-term disability exhausted on the 24th because Starbucks policy is that workman's comp is short-term disability so I am now on an unpaid leave of absence, lost my health insurance, and am trying to receive the mental health help I need from my eating disorder, to my family trauma (I was living with my abusive narcissistic alcoholic father bc I had nowhere else to go and was going to need major help after my surgery but he assaulted me the day before my birthday and was arrested for it last month and I had to put a protection order against him and I fled to OK since rent is cheaper and I‚Äôd be far away from him) and my medical trauma (C-PTSD) and there's nothing I can do to fight this... I have called lawyer after lawyer for going on 3 years now and I either get sent around from referral to another referral or I get told that I have no case they can help me with as soon as they hear it‚Äôs about Starbucks I need help suing‚Ä¶ I have no quality of life due to my knee injury, I am unable to work as I can‚Äôt even bend or lift up my right leg and I‚Äôm in tremendous excruciating pain every single day since my last surgery in May. They stopped my disability pay with no warning and now my cars been repoed bc I‚Äôm 20 days late on the payment, my phone is shut off, and I don‚Äôt even have half of the money I need for rent this month‚Ä¶ All because Starbucks has only screwed me over since my work-comp injury. I was wondering if someone might mind making a petition or GoFundMe for me or something to try and help me spread more light onto this horrible situation so that no partner ever has to suffer like I have had to the last 3 years over situations that could have easily been avoided and prevented but no one was willing to listen to me and take me seriously! Or might have any other ideas as to what I can do? I tried applying for the CUP fund and never heard back about it‚Ä¶ I cashed out my 401K and am almost out of that, I applied for UB since they fired me now but I highly doubt SBUX is going to grant me UB when I‚Äôve been on medical leave since 2019‚Ä¶ And so I'm just at a loss for what to do since I can‚Äôt work just any job anymore unfortunately (it‚Äôs really limiting where I can apply to while I‚Äôm waiting to hopefully get approved for SSDI in 4 months) and I need something where I can sit down throughout the day‚Ä¶ And I have to keep getting help and treatment for my mental health or I may not make it out of this alive and no one seems to care at Sedgwick or SBUX. I‚Äôm about to be evicted and homeless‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs all because I got injured helping out another store and Starbucks did not care to help take proper care of me and now I have been fired for not being able to go back to work yet when my surgeon has not even cleared me to work again yet‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry for this rant that probably makes no sense.

If he sees me from the store window sitting down on my break, he‚Äôll come and sit with me. He brought me flowers once. He once came in after I had been off for 4 days saying he was gonna invite me to this big art show but didn‚Äôt get the opportunity because I wasn‚Äôt at work. He once gave me a bunch of books he has about different artists. Yesterday we had to close early and he asked me through the window what days I‚Äôm working this week. I said I didn‚Äôt know. He knows I‚Äôm 19. He knew I was 18 when he began talking to me. He basically takes advantage of the fact that I‚Äôm a polite barista stationed in one place that he knows he can count on me being at least 3 days of the week to try and force some weird game on me. He seems really frustrated he doesn‚Äôt know my schedule. How do I tell him to leave me alone. I feel like he never goes so far that there isn‚Äôt plausible deniability. It makes me really angry and I want to confront him but as soon as he comes in I get this massive spike of fear and have to put all my energy into hiding it so I can work.

starbucks,"The company has been giving new benefits to non-union employees only, saying that they are legally forced to do so because ""everything must be negotiated first"".

But the complete opposite is true.

Not only is Starbucks free to give union employees as many benefits as they want, but they are **legally forced to give new benefits to BOTH non-union and union workers**.

The NLRB announced a while back that it would prosecute Starbucks for giving new benefits to non-union employees only. \[[source](https://www.axios.com/2022/08/26/starbucks-accused-withholding-benefits-union)\]

The NLRB's General Counsel stated that Starbucks' practice of announcing new benefits only for non-union workers is illegal in an interview with The Guardian.

Here is what the newspaper literally said \[[source 2](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/05/jennifer-abruzzo-nlrb-labor-lawyer-starbucks)\]:

&gt;Howard Schultz, Starbucks‚Äô CEO, has warned that the company would give raises and improved benefits to baristas at its non-union stores, but not to workers at stores that have already unionized or petitioned for a union election. Not only has this caused many baristas to hesitate about backing a union, but some labor leaders fear that other companies may embrace this potent anti-union tactic.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In an interview with the Guardian, Abruzzo was asked ‚Äì while avoiding mention of any particular company ‚Äì whether it was illegal for an employer to tell its workers that it will give raises and better benefits to its non-union workers, but not to its workers who recently voted to unionize and are seeking to negotiate their first contract.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI think saying that is an unfair labor practice,‚Äù Abruzzo said. ‚ÄúI would say it‚Äôs unlawful, absent compelling business justification.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúTo me that statement is inherently discriminatory conduct.‚Äù Federal law prohibits employers from taking discriminatory or retaliatory actions against workers for supporting a union.

So, what explains Starbucks' strategy?

Starbucks knows that if the unions win, the company's leaders will lose money because they will have to give more money and better benefits and working conditions to the workers.

So they are seeking to create the illusion that the workers would lose out by unionizing by threatening to with-hold benefits.

They are also creating new benefits to forestall discontent and avoid having to create *even more* benefits if unionization occurred.

My shifts are always getting after me to clean up after my messes and put away milks, but I feel like if I don't cut corners like that to crank drinks out timely, I'll never get put on bar. I already don't get much bar time, and I feel like I'm always barring during bar breakdown, which is always frustrating. 

Ranting aside, I want to improve, and I think I have the capacity to. But like I said, I've been a partner for a while, so I feel like my barring skills have plateaued, and I don't get many opportunities to hone that skill. Not to mention I get whiplash from different shifts' managing styles. Some shifts give me free pass to clean up after the rush has settled a little rather than as I go along, but some are hard asses who will point out every little spill you make. Another reason I'm not great at putting milks away is it's hard for me to bend too much because of my back injury. Which I guess is also why I don't get put on bar too much.

No necessarily with corporate, but customers and fellow baristas. 

Ever since I started I noticed that some partners try to be ‚Äúbetter than the rest‚Äù. One in particular was nice at first, but over time became more and more aggressive with me. This behavior started with small jokes here and there about myself, then it grew into toxic environment. Where I couldn‚Äôt come into work without feeling like I was going to leave worse than when I came in.

Management couldn‚Äôt do anything without critical action, when all I wanted was for everyone to just respect themselves and eachother.

Things are better with them now, and they‚Äôre moving locations permanently which does make me feel bad, but I know I wasn‚Äôt the only one having issues with them. I know they‚Äôre not feeling well and are struggling, but at the same time they‚Äôve had this same issue at almost 4 other locations.

My store manager there ended up complimenting my facial piercings multiple times and it turns out he saw the piercings from my piercers Instagram and knew and enjoyed them, saying they looked good on me. When I moved to my new store, the new dress code came out and my new and current store manager is saying if I don‚Äôt take out a piercing or get a new see through one, I will get written up. I explained that it was approved by Starbucks representatives who all said it would be okay and was approved by them, but she just said that we‚Äôll revisit the issue in a month and if it‚Äôs not fixed I‚Äôll be getting a write up. I‚Äôm just wondering if there‚Äôs any advice y‚Äôall could offer in what to do?

starbucks,"So I was a partner with Starbucks for a little over 2 years (I‚Äôm a 212), had been promoted to SSV after three months of being a barista, and left the company because of a major death in the family.

I was offered the job the day after my interview with a base salary of $65k plus the quarterly bonus structure.

My question is, for those of you working as SMs, is it worth coming back? I‚Äôve seen so much conflicting information online about how much the company has changed. Regarding the unions, if the store I‚Äôm handed wanted to unionize, I‚Äôd be behind them 100%. I have no negative feelings towards that, if that‚Äôs what partners want that‚Äôs what they should have.

I really like Starbucks, I love my partners, SSVs and manager but it‚Äôs just so much stress that I‚Äôm thinking about quitting. Everyday I‚Äôm there I feel like I won‚Äôt be able to end my shift and just walk out. Plus, I‚Äôm already noticing my own behaviour change during shift and sometimes being a little rude to customers because I‚Äôm focusing on the things to do. I have to remind myself multiple times during the day to calm down before I verbally assault someone. I‚Äôm supposed to be taking online classes after work but I get home so mentally tired I can‚Äôt even do it most of the time. Sometimes I‚Äôll get home, sit on the couch, hug my dog and stay like that for hours just decompressing. At this point, the only reason why I haven‚Äôt quit yet is because of the health benefits, but I‚Äôm thinking if it‚Äôs really worth it cause if I find another job that pays a little bit better I can shrink my budget a little and pay for the health insurance myself. I‚Äôm amazed to see people working at Starbucks for so many years and I wonder how do you guys handle that everyday?

starbucks,"I just applied to work at the Barnes and Noble Starbucks after a couple year break from the regular Bux. It's a part time gig that would leave me time for writing and I feel it would be a great environment for me because I loved making coffee and training new beans, but I made Starbucks culture my life in a way that ultimately detrimented my mental health. Having the sea of books nearby would be a comforting reminder that I have aspirations and goals outside of my work, and I am already fantasizing about walking the sea of shelves and finding daily inspo after shifts.

My questions are,

1. Did you find it easier or harder to score an interview with Bux experience, and did you add a cover letter or anything? 

I did not, and I am worried that that'll hurt me. I'm thinking of dropping off a hard copy of a cover letter/resume, but my former manager at the Green Castle hated when folks would call in or be too intrusive.

And, 

2. If you were hired, did you find the transition difficult? Is a licensed store more or less lax on corporate rules?

I was trained to do everything to the letter of the manual (sequence it ALL, only make one Frappuccino at a time, etc.) and I am concerned that I'll be too uppity or make old drink mistakes since the menu is constantly changing.",couple of questions for former partners who applied to B&amp;N licensed stores

starbucks,"I returned to Starbucks a month ago. The last time I worked here, I wasn't really trained beyond my first sip and I was basically permanently on DTO since I did it well. Recently I got rehired and properly trained. I've been having fun on bar, although I'm aware my speed needs to improve, especially since my store is high volume, we do about $10k/day. I barred with my SM the other day through peak, and she earnestly told me after that I did great, but I have 2 SSV's that I can tell have been talking shit about me because I do one thing wrong in front of them and suddenly I'm constantly getting reminders about basic ass shit from both of them. I can get frazzled and overwhelmed sometimes, but can you blame me when there's (genuinely, I wish I was exgaggersting this number) 50+ people in the lobby watching me? 

I'm just frustrated because although my SM is being really supportive and I feel like she's being honest about where I'm at, my SSV's are being really cruel and nitpicky. I have today off and I can't enjoy it because I get really upset thinking about work and how I'm being treated. It's been a month. Of course I'm still working on things, and I get how much pressure there is as SSV because I've been a manager before too, but it still hurts to be treated like this.

starbucks,"Hello! I worked for Starbucks for just over a month before quitting (this was December-January). I quit because the entire time I worked there I was never trained on bar whatsoever. They had me complete my online training from home, and then after that I was put on ovens for 6-8 hours a day. It was miserable. I decided to get a job at the licensed Starbucks inside of a Kroger down the road. While working there I got all trained up, and I'm actually the licensed Store leader now. However, I found out that the initial Starbucks I worked at started paying their baristas more than I was making as a lead, so I decided to reapply. I thought I'd be a no-brainer hire considering my experience, but I got an email the other day saying they would not be pursuing me as an employee. I've been a licensed store leader from January 'til now. I have some old friends who still work there that told me that they're desperate for employees, so why won't they hire me back? The only thing I can think of is that I initially gave a two weeks notice, but I had to cut it into a one weeks notice after contracting the flu. When I worked there they heavily stressed not to come in if you're sick, and I didn't have any experience anyways, besides working ovens, so I didn't think it'd be a big deal.

Right then, I fully accepted that I would just have to starve all day- the store was busy and I was late. Barista said no worries, I‚Äôll make something fast for you.

starbucks,"This might be an established normalcy but I think this makes no sense.

Before, about a month ago, if the store was understaffed, my home store would turn off mobile orders if (I asked the baristas about why the cafe was closed and they told me this was why). When I went to Denver last week, a PACKED Starbucks line greeted me to get my mobile order, but their cafe was closed so I had to get in line. They remade my drinks because it was 30 minutes after I should‚Äôve picked up. I thought that was weird, because they should‚Äôve just turned off their mobile orders, right?

Well now I‚Äôm in line at Starbucks in my hometown and I have to pick up my mobile order in the drive-thru. And it‚Äôs late because the line is like 15 cars deep, so the barista said they‚Äôd remake them when I got to the speaker. I feel terrible for the baristas remaking drinks and the store is probably doubling their waste.

- If it's where we can potentially grab it, should we do so or should we ask?
- If we have a drink and food and only get one, should we tell you about the other or assume someone will keep an eye out?

It's usually the most insanely small trivial thing too, and they'll get all pissy and rude about it.

And since I've been working for a while, I actually can tell that every store steps out of standard at least in some capacity.

My current store pours drinks down the hand washing sink. They use hot bar pumps for their cold bar. Ironically, one of the SSV is a total dick about people following standards for other things(re: something I posted about earlier).

If I do decide to enroll in the SIP, how much is a good amount to contribute? My inclination is to max out at 10% just because I can but is that a good idea or should I be more conservative? I'm also not eligible for free stocks this year because I quit in January and came back in May after the cutoff date so anything I had vesting and was going to be granted is gone.",Anyone here with experience contributing to the SIP?

starbucks,"In the drive thru I order a ""uhhhh...large nitro cold brew"" and was met with an answer of ""we can make you a venti nitro if we add some ice to it if you want to do that"" and in my non-caffeinated haze I say OK, figuring that some ice wouldn't make too much difference and maybe I'd get an extra ounce or two out of the drink this way.

I was given a cup that was packed fully to the brim with ice (never seen so much damn ice in a coffee drink in my life).  Is this normal protocol or did I just get punked by an individual store that felt like doing something like this?  I'm fairly dumb so I think the drink may actually have had less actual coffee drink in it than if I had gone with the normal grande sized nitro.  I feel ripped off.",I ordered a Venti nitro cold brew today....

starbucks,"So, I recently transferred stores for school. This store is unfortunately very understaffed (mostly in the shift supervisor realm) and I have had several shifts canceled in the past few weeks because there's no shift available. Btw, this is not the fault of the shifts we DO have at all because they are at work all. the. time. and deserve all the time off in the world. They pick up extra shifts all the time but we essentially have 2 (two!!) shifts for the store. 

This is just getting super frustrating. I'm a full time student with two jobs (Starbucks being the primary one) and I have rent, car payment, insurance, tuition, etc. to pay. I understand I have limited availability but I'm usually scheduled around 15 hours so even one shift being taken away when I'm counting on it is a huge hit.

starbucks,"so ive been a parter since late 2020, got fired at that first store bc i worked 50+ hrs a week every week and ended up being late often, which ig is understandable. 

started again in around may?/june? this year at a different store and me and my SM got along incredibly well. then shortly after she was on vacay, and partners were leaving milks out and i told them to stop bc thats a huge safety violation. the SM by proxy reported saying i ""cussed out partners"" and is known to try to get ppl fired. nothing we could do about it. 

second report i didnt even know why i was sent home until my SM talked about the report, wasnt taken to the back and talked to. it was over a joke that i didnt know was triggering to someone. SM said the report was BS. 

third report was absolutely random out of nowhere a shift manager saying ""youre good to go home"", again no talks in the back on what i was doing. still no clue why i was sent home. we were even short staffed.

the report that got me fired was me being incredibly mentally unwell (ive been suicidal for the past few weeks, esp now im unemployed) and i asked if i was able to go home without it being a report and was told yes, but the report said i quit.

im aware when im stressed and (tw abuse) only know to express stress through being intimidating bc i was raised in an abusive household. its not an excuse but i wish shift managers would do their part n letting ppl know if they seem stressed to move them to a diff possition or sent them in the back to calm down. a partner at that store is a hothead just like me but has never been reported, and my SM has said she swears people just didnt wanna get to know me bc of my protective shell to keep ppl from fcking w me. as soon as i was gonna ask if we could have a meeting to talk to partners about me and what to do when im stressed (my SM said ppl see me on the dcr and know they can slack, so i was doing 3 jobs at once) but learned i was separated. my SM apparently is super upset. 

i sent a suspension appeal and they said itd take 3-5 days, and i didnt act a victim bc i know its something im working on, but i mentioned ive never been taken to the back to ""take a breather"" or be told what i did wrong, bc obv id work on it. its been 7 days. i was already living paycheck by paycheck. is this a good or bad sign. im applying to other jobs but i rlly loved that store and there were def some ppl thats goal was to get me fired. i know i need to try my best to put a face on the floor but it only got harder as i started stressing about reports

any advice would be lovely. esp regarding how long the suspension repeal is taking. thank you. i rlly love working for starbucks and as soon as i started i made the place more clean and food/drink safe. it just sucks. every time my life starts to feel like its going to get better, it crashes.",trenta sized needed advice about being fired

He goes by the book on everything (which is not necessarily a bad thing) but gives you an overview on the type of person he is. He thinks he knows everything and everything needs to be his way. He raises his voice and scolds us all as if we're children. He clearly looks miserable at the job, complained in the back that all of the baristas are ""retards""and how he should be more praised and respected by corporate to one of the other shifts.

It seems as if I always have to be on my toes around this store manager and It is so toxic. Two shift managers have quit within the last two weeks as well as three baristas. He demanded me to pull cash before I left at 2pm and I explained I never was trained on how to do it. He responded to figure it out and shook his head saying i should know this while walking away . Long story short, I miscounted and one of the pulls was over by $13. He came back over and was like,"" well, well,well what's going on over here?"" It seems as if he gets a fix from making others feel inferior. He ended up going on a rant about how I need to know this even though I explained my lack of training. He also expects me to do counts/ inventory and that,"" you just need to count, its not hard"".I come home after every shift feeling stressed and horrible by his petty comments.

but i just wanna say that you guys are doing great. one of the new baristas was on the cold drink side making like refreshers and teas. i ordered an iced tea so it was with her. she apologized that it took so long (some people who ordered hot drinks after me got their drinks before me, i really don't mind because i wasn't in a hurry and i'm not an asshole who can't read) and seemed ready to break down, i think people in the early morning i showed up were giving the baristas at this location a hard time. of course i made sure to comfort her and when i sipped my tea lemonade it was PERFECT! so i'm not even upset at all! i'm saddened that people felt the need to be upset at her and the other baristas because they took their time to make things properly.

starbucks,"I‚Äôve been working as a barista at Starbucks for 3 months roughly, this is my first job. When I first started, my mama her nitpicked me a lot which is completely understandable since I was new. However, even now when I would consider very capable at the roles I‚Äôm assigned, she still picks on me a lot. Sometimes, I do understand if I genuinely make a mistake but even with other coworkers, it either gets laughed off or not even mentioned. Every time I make a mistake, I get told off and she immediately assumes mistakes made are always done by me. For example, if somebody leaves out the antibacterial spray, if the broom is left out etc etc. I get told off when I don‚Äôt even do these things. I‚Äôm naturally a very conscientious person so I make sure not to do these things. Of course, I make mistakes such as that I was chewing gum or something like that. I get told off literally for not tightening my apron enough. She assumes mistakes made for example the routine for making pumpkin cream was me when it was my coworker, but I said nothing because I can‚Äôt be bothered. 

Today, my coworker was solo on bar at one point because my manager who was supposed to support him was busy cleaning the shop floor. I was on support so he asked me if I could do the frappuccino for him since he was so busy. My manager has this thing where she doesn‚Äôt like people coming near the bar area because it gets crowded, obviously that doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense since you have to go in the bar area to clean up jugs or package takeaways etc. Either way, we all make it a habit not to and give her food halfway. At times, I get told off for crossing because I try to give food to customers because I think everyone else is busy. My manager always tell me off for that, I somewhat understand that this is just her style of working. She comes back today to tell me whilst I‚Äôm mid making a frappuccino saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôve told you not to cross over this side, blah blah blah‚Äô and I‚Äôm thinking who else was supposed to help. So then I say ‚Äòwell do you want me to make the frappuccino or not?‚Äô but I just leave it there for her to finish because I don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt want to be annoyed and it‚Äôs probably not in my best interests to talk back to my manager but I feel like the scapegoat all the time. People get let off all the time even someone who joined after me but for me that never happens.

I‚Äôm also never really put on bar and wasn‚Äôt formally trained for it. Luckily, I‚Äôve managed to master nearly all the drinks myself but I never get to practice since I do morning shifts mostly and I‚Äôm not asked to do bar in rush hour. Then, I see my coworker who joined after me doing bar, I feel completely useless. I get annoyed at him too because O try to do support and for example, steam milk etc and his job today was literally the till and then he takes it upon himself to do that and then my job of steaming milk or queuing shots. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. I tried to stand my ground today so that he didn‚Äôt swap roles with me and make me do till because I wanted to do support on bar so I stayed standing there. Maybe this is entitled of me but why, if he is asked to do till, is he now overtaking me? Again, within rush hour or morning, our roles are told to us every morning by the SM so there‚Äôs no case of just swapping unless it‚Äôs quieter etc. 

I spoke to my friend about this and she said I can‚Äôt speak back to my manager and I‚Äôm basically blacklisting myself. I agree but it‚Äôs difficult to keep apologising or just taking it for the sake of company hierarchies. I just feel that I work hard and perform well and I‚Äôm still treated worse. Even when my other coworker first joined after me, he even said he noticed that the manager always picks on me. I think from now on I‚Äôm just not going to talk back but I don‚Äôt find this fair. What would be the best solution?",I hate the way I‚Äôm becoming at work but equally I don‚Äôt like the way I‚Äôm treated

So today I came inside instead and ordered my iced blonde latte, gave my name, and when I took a first sip of my drink it was very sweet. It didn‚Äôt taste like syrup though and I checked the bottom of the cup and there were black flecks like from the vanilla bean powder. 
I almost went in to have it remade bc I really wasn‚Äôt in the mood for a sweet drink, but then I thought maybe they were trying to do something nice.

starbucks,"Trigger Warning, Talks of mental illness and such

&amp;#x200B;

Today I had a chat with my new SM and ASM.

It was about my hours and how I need more, as I am facing a big mental and financial crisis and have been for quite a while. For months I have worked 18 hours a week at best and had to get a second job at MAYBE gives me another 4 hours a week if I am lucky(I don't even WORK there this week, they just didn't put me on). I am in school, I have rent to pay, and other life things(bills, groceries, the works) that I have made some choices to keep a roof over my head and food then my own health. Not that its a reliable roof and am teetering on losing that too. I have been telling my old SM about this for a while, and was ignored, hence the second job.

I suffer from really bad clinical depression, like REALLY bad. I also have ADHD and Anxiety, not to mention PCOS and some liver issues that I need to have investigated. I haven't taken any of my medications in a very, very long time. Its expensive and I can't afford to go to the doctor every month for my anti-depressants, mood medication, and diabetes medications(its used as a preventative since PCOS can cause Diabetes). Not to mention get blood tests every 3-6 months to keep an eye on my liver and thyroid. TLDR: I have been in a perpetual deep depression for a very long time.

It was a shit show from the start, I'm stressed, I am at rock bottom point and I am begging to the point I am crying and going into a mental breakdown for hours. I feel like I have been in a state of mental breakdown for weeks. So I can see a doctor and get my medications, not live paycheck to paycheck, to stop feeling so sick all the time. I just need 25 hours, just that much, I'll do anything, I just want to get better. I want to go back to not having constant needs of self harm and suicide. I try, I try to not have these thoughts and be constructive, but its a losing battle even with therapy. And I know it will get worse in the coming months, winter is always the worst for me. Hell, I admitted that my therapist wanted me to be emitted to the fucking hospital, I had a welfare check done on me by my fucking mom with cops, I am not in the best state of mine ATM.

I sobbed like a baby for the bare minimum, as a 23-year-old, in front of someone who never met me at this point cause I need them to listen to me. I'm embarrassed and wanna curl up and die.

Also: I can't go to C.U.P Fund because I have used it before. I fucked up on my tax forms when I started at SBux, a typo that added an extra 0 were it shouldn't be, that led to me not being paid my first 3 paychecks. I was shy, new and in a predicament then too, I owed debt collectors and in between homes at the time so I really felt those lost checks. Fixed the issue and was given some money from the fund to pay off some of the debt and get back into a my parents house and pay them my past-due rent. So that has been out of the picture for a while( I wont be eligible again in a couple weeks from now).",I embarrassed myself

 We‚Äôre an $10-15k/day store, and we had a few call outs on top of our already-skeleton crew to start the morning off.

I could handle having a conversation with a customer over the headset and a customer in the window at the same time, I could handle customers being mad at the wait time, I could even handle doing all that while also putting food in and handing out mobiles. But I accidentally handed out ONE wrong drink, which then my supervisor took the time to then chew me out about, despite none of us having the time to get chewed out or to chew out. I was holding back tears for the next two cars, then one of my regulars rolled up and asked me how I was doing and I just lost it.

starbucks,"I got hired over a week ago. The interview went decently and the next day I got an email saying they'd like to take me on as a Barista. I put in my two weeks (well, a week and a half) at my job and I was ready to start that next week. I got an email to do the background check and I finished submitting that information in about an hour. Days passed, no response. After about 5ish days I emailed the manager again and asked if there was anything he needed me to submit. No response.   


I decided to go into the store today and ask if the manager was there and if I could speak with him. A few employees came over and said that he had actually quit and was the only manager that worked at their location. I told them I was hired and they said it would be fine if I already filled out my paperwork and I should most likely be scheduled anyway. I told them I hadnt done the paperwork yet because it was never sent to me and... well thats all. No solution was offered. IDK what to do.

My last day for my job was Sunday and I havent been working since. I fully expected to already be starting this job by now because thats what the manager told me we would be able to do if I were to be hired. I cant really take a mini vacay between jobs right now. What do I do?",I got hired but right after the manager quit. Help?

starbucks,"so. i‚Äôve been working at my store for over a year now, and i just returned from a LOA in may this year, due to a car accident i had in december prior. for context, my store manager had been transferred to a new store when i went on my LOA, and when i returned we had 1 manager and a covering manager until eventually our original store manager returned back to our store. 

while the covering manager from a different store in our district was overseeing us, she made a bunch of approvals for availability that i think weren‚Äôt in our stores best interest in the long run, but whatever, i was one of the people to change my availability because i was working 2 jobs at the time. 

my returning store manager has been back for about 2 months at this point, and she just recently started scheduling me on saturdays, where i have no availability. i work part time, and i made my days off saturday, sunday, and thursdays so i could work my second job then. 

i ended up leaving my second job because of personal issues with the management, but i never changed my availability back in the hopes i could find a second job again in the future. i still have sundays and thursdays off, but i wanted to know if it was necessary to be scheduled 5 days a week when that‚Äôs not in my availability? 

the hours i ask for are 25/week, and i never get that either, it always varies from 20 to 30 hours a week. how do i go about addressing this kind of scheduling? 

i hear from my coworkers that we have to work 1 weekend day, but i know there are coworkers of mine who work 3-4 days a week, get the hours they ask for every week, and the proper days off. so i‚Äôm feeling kind of miffed over this, especially because my store manager didn‚Äôt even discuss this scheduling change with me.",scheduling availability

A couple days ago I submitted online applications to all the starbucks in my area, but something in my gut told me that wasn't enough, so today I printed out my resume and went to my local store in person. When I got there, I asked for a manager and if he had 10 minutes to spare with me for an interview. (I planned my arrival time so that it wasn't too busy when I got there)

I think he was a little suprised? Once he realized I was there for an interview, I mentioned that I thought it was better to come in person and  he told me that it was a great idea because it really put a face to a name. He revealed that he had 58 PENDING applications online! (sheesh)

Then, he asked me my availability and to my luck I'm completely free. I'm transferring colleges from chicago to houston and my family lives here so I have nothing to do but work for the next couple months until the spring semester comes. He seemed to be pleasantly suprised by that too. ain

He said he couldn't sit down with me because he was working the floor, but could I come in friday for an interview? I said ""sure!"" and he made sure that I had my phone number which was printed near the top of my resume. 

Then, he complimented my outfit and got me a drink to go! (the drink felt like a trick question but I got something simple)

So, the question is.. do I have it in the bag? My brother ""who works as a hiring manager at a resteraunt chain"" seems to think I already got the job essentially if I do well on the interview. Is this true? Or should I try not to put all my eggs in one basket?

Roughly two weeks, actually, without ever receiving a verbal warning, or any type of indication or communication that this even happened. I‚Äôm unsure it actually did. This ‚Äúwrite-up‚Äù came a day after asking for a transfer with another sm who used to work at my location because I am too uncomfortable speaking with my current sm. The old sm also got into contact with the dm about the situation. When I had asked my current sm for a transfer, at the end of august, prior to this, they simply told me a roundabout no, and refused to provide more information or resources, thus I asked elsewhere. During the process of my ‚Äúwrite up‚Äù I had mentioned how poorly the store was being run in many words, and felt that my receiving a reprimand for such a mistake was on an unfair basis. The sm had another sm sitting in on our meeting. Due to how the conversation went I began to feel Ill and massively uncomfortable returning to finish my shift, so I went home sick.

starbucks,"Hello r/starbucks,

When I order an iced latte with raw sugar, about 80-90% of the time, the barista seems to put the raw sugar in at the very end when making the drink. The sugar of course doesn't mix properly in the cold milk, and just clumps up at the bottom. 

Picture for reference:
[https://imgur.com/KN3lWff](https://imgur.com/KN3lWff)

The other 10-20% of the time, the barista will (I assume this is what they do anyway) mix the raw sugar in with the hot espresso shots first, before pouring it in the cup and adding the ice and the milk. This results in no sugar blob at the end of the drink. This is what I want to have all the time!

Should I be asking the barista to stir the sugar in with the espresso first? How should I order my drink to avoid the clumped-up-raw-sugar-blob in the future?

* A redesigned cold beverage station that allows baristas to cut down the time it takes to make frozen drinks by more than half

I come in to work and then go home unless I'm around my favorite coworkers, then i stay after my shift for a bit. The coworkers I don't really even talk to (""popular kids"" group) make group chats to talk about me, but of course, I'm not the only one. Those same coworkers talk about people in the group chat to me and talk about people outside of it for messing up on drinks, or making a mistake, etc. I always knew, but it was confirmed. Im sure the manager always knew because it is a ""We're a family."" Type of location and they mentioned not to talk about people at a mandatory meeting. Why else mention it if you didn't know about it? And what are you actually doing to stop it? Some coworkers cry over this and feel broken down. Some of these coworkers come to ME crying and broken down from these groups or the manager and I'm just another barista stuck in the middle of it.

The funny thing is, I see the appeal of working at Starbucks. When working with the few who's actually drama free and just trying to help each other get through the day, Starbucks is pretty nice to work at, but those select few just doesn't fix the whole location. 

I shouldve left when i originally wanted to which was only a month into hire, but finding another job has been hard.(sad i know, but the second i started, i noticed the immediate issues) You climb up the ranks, you get talked about poorly whether you deserved it or not. Promotions given out unfairly. You do everything right, it's not noticed. You don't learn something at their speed, you're talked about. You don't make conversation with them, they're personally offended (and yes, ive gotten the ""You dont talk much, but its okay"" manager talk). You ask questions, they get annoyed, but if you mess up, you're talked about. God forbid you have a disability. It's always ""we support you"" until they realize disabilities aren't this quirky thing and can actually hinder your work. It's ridiculous, especially with everyone there being adults lol. No one there is under the age of 18 and they behave this way in their big ages. I graduated high school back in 2016, but it seems like here, I never left.

But I'll miss the ones I enjoyed working with, especially my favorite shift manager the most. I hope everything goes well for them and they're able to leave as well because they truly deserve better. They're treated poorly there. The shifts with them are always nice and fun. They've always been understanding and a patient teacher. When it came to my pronouns, they've improved so much without the tired ""I was never taught this."". No excuses, they just took their time to learn, ask me questions and they got it. They're how I imagine a manager should be, but that's a totally different rant in itself. I'll be missing those lyft rides too. And who knows, I'd love to come back (if i dont land my career in the next few years). Hopefully to a location where there's more emotional intelligence and just common decency. It's unfortunate out of this whole experience, my team was the worst part of it.",I'm leaving and it's bittersweet: Trenta rant
starbucks,"Hello, I‚Äôm seeking some help to find out what steps I should take to report this behavior to the right people.

Essentially here‚Äôs the gist. I recently transferred to a new Starbucks several states away from home, as I‚Äôll be staying in this new location for months. Before I was properly scheduled at this new store, I worked as a borrowed partner for another store nearby and had no issues other than some typical ‚Äúhaving to relearn where everything is etc‚Äù type stuff. It was a good store!

Flash forward to this new store. It‚Äôs been nothing but problems, some small, and others bigger. All concerns nonetheless.

This specific issue culminated in this moment: I was working a long shift and was oddly scheduled my half hour break not long after I showed up. Pushing my two 10 minute breaks until later in the day. I keep working and working until 30 mins before I leave, when I‚Äôm sent on my first 10. To which I respond, ‚ÄúI still haven‚Äôt gotten my 2nd 10 either, Should I take that too?‚Äù And I‚Äôm met with the title: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do that here‚Äù In my shock, I manage to say ‚ÄúWhat? What do you mean?‚Äù To which the SM, as well as the shift try to half-assedly give me an explanation about how ‚ÄúIf you get a break within X amount of time, you don‚Äôt get a second 10‚Äù This has never been an issue at either of the other stores I‚Äôve worked at. I tried looking up our ruling for breaks online, since I don‚Äôt have my handbook where I‚Äôm currently staying. I wasn‚Äôt able to turn up much that was from an official Starbucks source (so if anyone has a link to such info it would be greatly appreciated in this case!) I bring up to my manager after my 10 that I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a company wide policy (unless the specific state has its own strict labor laws that change things) And she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll look that up for you and get back to you on that.‚Äù

Fast forward to today. I‚Äôm talking with a fellow barista, someone who is more close to the management side of things than most, and he told me that my SM told him something along the lines of ‚ÄúIf he wants to throw the book at me, then I‚Äôm not scheduling him 8 hour shifts anymore.‚Äù

Am I correct in believing this is wrong and retaliatory? As well as creates as hostile work environment? I love some of the new peeps I work with. But there‚Äôs been so much drama and just wrong things at this store for no reason, that I could just go on about all the things that they‚Äôre doing incorrectly/not by the book. All of which i‚Äôve let slide up till now.

As well as this whole break debacle. I‚Äôve also heard from SEVERAL other baristas that this SM has the habit to often cut off extra time you stay and work. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre scheduled 6am-12pm but leave at 12:08 because it‚Äôs busy and you didn‚Äôt have anyone to cover your position, she tends to cut that extra time off by editing your punch. Which is theft of time.

I want to make sure I take appropriate action going forward, which is why I‚Äôm posting here. Thank you!",‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do that here‚Äù - Seeking steps forward in this case of management abuse.

starbucks,"Okay I'd be interested  to see how you would approach this. I had a customer come in today and order a venti decaf caramel coffee Frappuccino (I hate making this, I really do) and so my barista rings her up for it. As I'm making the drink, she comes up to me and asks if I can split her drink into two tall cups. At this point we were in rushtime and I didn't have the time nor the energy to reline 2 cups with caramel so I told her I could give her the cups and she could split it herself. She walks away satisfied and I am satisfied so I continue on bar. I finally get her drink out with the two cups only for to look at me and rudely state that she wanted it in the the cups. So I explained to her that could do it herself or that I'd be happy to refund her venti drink and ring her up for two tall decaf caramel Coffee Frappuccinos. I could have probably been more polite about it but I had a mile long line of drinks, I did not want to get into it. 

Anyways, bottom line is that I'm tired of customers asking for venti drinks only to turn them into smaller ones with hacks. Like, I get why you would do that but ultimately you're  still getting a venti measured drink so it would be twice as sweet as it ought to be.

When she hands me the coffee, I go to take a sip and the lid which was not sealed correctly falls off and the coffee spills all over me and burns me.

The girl at the window was doing other stuff at that point and didn‚Äôt even notice, so I called her over and tell her that the lid was not sealed and then it just poured all over me. She is extremely apologetic and gets me some napkins, and a new dark roast. She asked me if I want more napkins and I tell her no, it was just extremely hot. I was taken aback and honestly surprised that they didn‚Äôt do more or refund me in the moment, that‚Äôs the least that could be done with this coffee burning me.

And I start to move down to where I grab my drink from and she says ""Oh my God I'm so sorry but we have no sandwiches left either.""

New store. Started working at starbucks in '17(244****).

I work really really well. I don't stress, if something wrong happens I don't really mind. I'm very friendly. I think I'm a good worker(for my own sake, not bc I care about corporate lol).

And to be blunt, I work incredibly well on bar.

The new store is very small. Has one blender and one shaker.

I had 3 separate shaken drinks.

A venti iced brown sugar shaken espresso, and a venti and grande dragon fruit refresher.

1. I prep everything in the shaker for the brown sugar, with my blonde shots queuing.

We only have one shaker, I have two more shaken drinks to make. The four shots take a few seconds to pull

2. While waiting for the shots, I put the proper size of ice scoop in the grande and venti, and then a scoop of the inclusions on top of each.

3. When my brown sugar was finished and completed, I was going to rinse the shaker. Measure out the dragon base and then the water to the right line. And then I was going to dump the ice and fruit inside before I shake.

I was going to do that separately for both drinks. Both drinks were independently shaken with the ice and berries inside. With the right amount of ice, base, water, and inclusion.

But because I ""took a shortcut"" and prepped my drinks by putting ice and berries in the cup, a barista tossed my drink out. Because I didn't ""follow starbucks standard.""

Refused to listen. Refused to let me explain. She then lectured me verh loudly on the floor in front of partners and customers.

We used to have 6 shifts but one left for a smaller store and another is considering stepping down.

i feel slow and stupid on every shift. i never get through a day without making some kind of mistake whether its giving the wrong amount of change or not connecting enough. my store hates me. i dont blame them. i hate the person this job has made me into. my manager told me that the whole morning shift asked for me to be taken off of mornings and that they're all ""afraid to talk to me"". are SMs supposed to say stuff like that? i had a panic attack in my car on the way home from that talk. i wanted to transfer stores but now i have a write up. i would try to transfer anyways, but the write up says that i took too long on a break and that i've been ""sassy."" no sm will take a barista like that. fun fact: in said write up, it states that i messed up while making cold brew (the bag broke after i put the grounds and water in. there was no way i couldve known.), asked if i would be written up for messing up on it, and then ""did not seem to care"". (why would i ask if i didnt care???) also an sv was instructed to coach me on making cold brew after that. he seemed to hate every minute of it.

my SVs gossip about everybody. i wonder what they say about me. this job is killing my mental health. every day i think about hurting myself with a box cutter. i know i suck skill-wise even compared to the new people and i am literally only here for SCAP. hoping to take more classes and get out as soon as i can, because i am afraid that if i just leave, i wont finish college. i just hope my suffering ends soon so that i can stop being a burden to my store.

The pandemic made me realize that it was kind of infuriating to be relying on a good manager for basic protection and support, and that even when the company was doing the right thing by us it could just as easily be taken away without our really having a say in the matter.

pov: you call out of your shift an hour before it starts (it was an emergencyüò≠) you tell your trainee you cant come in and they're cool about it. your old manager for some reason didn't input your trainee's schedule into the system, so it shows up on the dcr as coverage when it is not a coverage shift and you have been training someone for two weeks straight, it's just that the trainee isnt on the dcr. 

so you call the store and your new manager (literally, its day two) tells you that you need to find coverage for your shift. i'm confused because there is no coverage, and im the only one training her. i explain this to her and tell her that the old manager didn't schedule my trainee for those two weeks and my trainee knows her shifts off a piece of paper she was given. she clocks in and off using timeclock.

Gives all of us dramatic long lectures about following exact policies and rules that are never that serious. It gets really annoying especially coming from someone who's so fresh talking down to much longer experienced partners on our team as if we don't know what we're doing, or that everything we do is wrong(??). I usually try to just walk away and ignore it and continue working when these lectures happen but it makes me feel hostile and grumpy afterwards.

starbucks,"Hopefully my 2 weeks expire before I get fired, because I'm being hunted.  


Basically, a few months ago I made the decision to head off to college, and I used to work at a store back by where I lived. We were high volume and would regularly set record drive times of 23-26 second window times during peaks. When I decided to head off to college, I spoke to my absolutely amazing store manager there and requested a transfer to a specific store closer to where I will be living for college, since a 4-hour commute to work does not sound fun. She put in the transfer once we contacted the store manager of the place I was transferring to, and we thought it would be all grand by the time I got here.  


Fast forward 2 months (the transfer filing time), and I hear nothing from the new store manager regarding the transfer, so I try to get into contact again, to no avail. So I tried again. And again. and again - for about 15 attempts over the span of 3 weeks. I got no response (these were all phone calls to the store). I finally contacted my old SM and was told to ""tell them flat out that if you cant get a shift there that you'd have to find employment elsewhere, try emailing them &amp; call them one more time, since they've surpassed their deadline by such a great amount, if you don't hear back from them in 2 days then look elsewhere or I can file transfer paperwork elsewhere."" So I sent an email, and said I'd call one last time in the morning, when I could personally guarantee that their SM would be on shift.  


So I called, and was greeted by a temp SM who was there for the week since the actual SM just left for vacation, and they handled my transfer with ease and no problems. Well, that just got finalized 3 days ago. I got a phone call today from the actual SM (I worked one shift as a ""borrowed"" thanks to the temp SM scheduling me), and was informed that I ""Might not be a good fit for our store"", and that ""I would have to review the partner code for tone problems and disrespect, as reported by our baristas"" (Mind you, I didn't disrespect anyone or have bad tone, nor have I ever had this problem in the past, as I've usually been regarded as the 'preferred employee' by various stores who have borrowed me for shifts, due to how well I can function within their crew and how friendly I am towards them). That call was the snapping point for me, and as of right now I have typed out my two weeks and will be resigning tomorrow. I have filed a formal complaint with Starbucks regarding the management of the store, and will be gone regardless of the result by the first of October. I was also guaranteed that if I do it this way I would still have a summer job at my old starbucks down south, since they enjoyed me there.   


Now, obviously a single bad call cant be the only reason I'm quitting, right? No, it's not:   
My new store has:  
 \- Ghosted me on my transfer for several weeks  
 \- Expressed hostility from the SM several times, despite only speaking with them 2 times  
 \- Placed me with 2 coworkers who disrespect anyone and everyone  
 \- Placed me with a coworker (not from the above 2) who has a SEVERE superiority complex  
 \- No customer connections or any behind bar connections with coworkers (Seriously, one guy on the afternoon shift actually connects with customers, and unless you're a supervisor or SM you're not allowed to talk to any coworkers aside from communicating an order).  
 \- No in-store communication on orders (I know, the only thing we're allowed to speak about and no one actually communicates anything regarding them?)

starbucks,"I've recently learned some new things about myself (woo, self-discovery), and for the most part, my fellow partners all have been super supportive and understanding. It's a bit of a change, and it's taking some time for people who have known me for a while to get used to using new pronouns and all that, but overall, it's been a generally positive experience. However, we've recently had a temporary change in command at my store, and the temp store manager we have has consistently misgendered me, both to my face and with other people. I've corrected them, and I want to believe it is a genuine mistake whenever they do it, but it is really frustrating. My thought is that maybe they are having a hard time with it because my partner information still says the wrong gender. With the recent addition of Partner Central, I can see that, while I have self-disclosed my correct gender to the company, my partner information is still incorrect, and there doesn't seem to be a way, at least from home, to correct it.

Does anyone know if there is a way for me to update it without having to call, or is that the only way I'll be able to correct it? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",Can you update your gender in partner central?

I'm also a graduate student, though, and within the past few weeks I have received a position on my campus that involves research/daily work, meaning I can no longer work as much as usual.

I've been doing 15.5 hrs/week currently (not a lot I know), and I made a request to go down to 11 starting in 3 weeks. My manager accepted this change and even spoke to me about it in person last week, but now that our most recent schedule has been posted, though it is beyond the threshold for my change, I'm still at 15.5 hours. I'm working full-time alongside going to school essentially, so I cannot manage my 15.5 at SB like I was able to back in the Spring.

starbucks,,"Does Starbucks Star points expire or go down? If so, why?"
starbucks,"So I manage a licensed kiosk in a grocery store in a very busy tourist area. 

We have (or had, I guess) a regular customer named Lisa. (Not her real name, but changed to protect the innocent.) Lisa is older, a disabled veteran (this is important info later) and just a little bit crazy. (She would come in spouting off insane conspiracy theories and acting rather alarming more often than not.) She would come in once a week and order a Venti hot Mocha and then would order an additional four Mochas but made with cold milk instead of steamed milk. She didn‚Äôt want them iced. She wanted them in hot cups but for us to just skip steaming the milk because she would take them home, store them in her refrigerator, and heat them up to drink throughout the week. Not a problem. We didn‚Äôt mind doing it for her.

But Lisa is‚Ä¶ difficult. And that is putting it nicely. She refused to ‚Äúallow‚Äù one of my baristas to make her drinks because said barista smelled too nice and her drinks would taste like her if she made them? This barista DOES smell nice, but it‚Äôs not like she bathes in Chanel No 5 before she comes in to work. She just practices basic hygiene, which personally I‚Äôm very thankful for. (Have you ever had to have a conversation with an employee about the importance of deodorant??? I have and it is awkward and unpleasant. I have never had to have this conversation with this particular barista so I‚Äôm pretty A-OK with her.) 
Lisa also wants her cold mochas stirred because the ‚Äúcold milk doesn‚Äôt dissolve the mocha sauce and it doesn‚Äôt taste right unless it is stirred.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt matter that we add hot espresso to the mocha before we add the milk. It still needs to be stirred. But we absolutely can NOT stir it with a wooden stir stick because, you guessed it! Her cold, four day old mocha will taste like wood when she finally gets it out of her refrigerator and decides to drink it. We also can‚Äôt stir her drink with a bar spoon because she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúknow how long it has been since it has been washed.‚Äù So we have to open a straw in front of her and stir each of her cold mochas with said straw.

If this isn‚Äôt difficult and annoying enough, Lisa would buy her drinks and then come back 3 or 4 days later complaining that they didn‚Äôt taste right and demanding that we remake ALL of them for her free of charge. 

Now I‚Äôm all about making the moment right, but I‚Äôm not all about replacing a three day old drink that was perfectly fine when she bought it. I would refuse to do this for her, so she would come in when I wasn‚Äôt there and bully other baristas into doing it. She once demanded a remake of all of her drinks because she had an unexpected emergency and was out of town for a week and wasn‚Äôt able to drink her coffees before they went bad. Since she had paid for them but wasn‚Äôt able to enjoy them, it was obviously up to us to ‚Äúmake the moment right‚Äù and give her some new ones. I refused and it hit the fan. I was accused of being anti veteran (I am NOT) and she just couldn‚Äôt understand how I would treat a disabled person this way. I had to get the grocery store manager involved and she was very firmly told that from that moment on, she would have to taste every one of her drinks before she left the store in order to insure that they were made correctly. If they didn‚Äôt taste right that very moment, we would happily remake them before she left the store but we would never again be asked to remake her drinks days after she purchased them.

Things settled down for awhile. UNTIL. I hired on a new wave of employees and she tried to start up the same cycle with them. I intervened and she blew up on me, calling me every name under the sun after I told her that I was not going to serve her until she and I had a conversation about her continual abuse towards my employees. I had to once again get the grocery store manager involved and when Lisa saw him coming to speak with her, she panicked and ran out of the store, with a shopping cart full of bananas that she definitely did NOT pay for and fled the scene.

She later called the store that she had just recently stolen a bunch of bananas from and threatened legal action for our ‚Äúdiscriminatory behavior‚Äù towards her.

She hasn‚Äôt been back since so I call it a win.

Oh, and the best part? She tried to get an incredibly sweet older man who works in our deli to vouch for her that she is a ‚Äúgood person who doesn‚Äôt deserve to be treated this way.‚Äù  Turns out she had been trying to convince this guy to quit his job and run away with her so they could travel the world together. Funnily enough, he decided NOT to do this after witnessing her behavior.

You seriously cannot make this stuff up!

starbucks,"This month I quit my job at arguably the most successful coffee chain company, which I once embraced and fully loved. I worked there for just over 3.5 years. While there are multiple reasons that I decided to leave, I wanted to share my experience with reporting sexual harassment.

In February of 2021, two years into my employment at this company. A shift supervisor transferred to the store where I had worked since it opened. He ended up sexually harassing not only me but multiple female employees, including minors.

For a few months, I was in denial about the misconduct. However, many of my co-workers pointed out the ""special interest"" the shift supervisor had taken with me. Once it was shared with me that he had said borderline predatory comments to minors at my store, I decided enough was enough.

Initially, I was hesitant to speak out about the harassment because I knew the district manager favored him. They had weekly meetings about potentially making him an ASM.

I drafted a document outlining the harassment. I had close to fifteen of my fellow baristas who either experienced harassment or witnessed it sign their names. I presented it to my store manager, who then escalated it to the DM.

Bare minimum, I asked that this shift supervisor be transferred to another store, as he already covered shifts at other stores. I was told that it couldn't happen because it would be a form of retaliation against him.

From that point on, there was a corporate investigation for months. I continued working at the store, as did my harasser, our store manager scheduled us at different times to prevent overlap.

By late June 2021, he was no longer employed by the company. I found out when a barista told me he was seen dropping off his store key.

In October of 2021, I was told by a reputable source from another store that not only does this former shift supervisor frequent this store, he asked to be re-hired. I was under the impression that he was banned from the stores because I have seen bans implemented for much less.

Come December of 2021, while I'm working, the former supervisor comes in to pick up his tips and sees me and vice versa.

We ended up having this conversation in the BOH, where other employees overheard, even though I said I wasn't prepared to have that conversation.

I talked about how my mental health was negatively impacted and how I wasn't happy about how the situation was handled. I said it didn't make sense to me that a former shift supervisor was able to come into the store that he was fired from for sexual misconduct. The district manager told me he wasn't fired for those reasons but did not disclose why he was terminated. I also mentioned that management never followed up with me about my sexual harassment claim or the man in the cafe who assaulted me. The DM was adamant that he followed up with me because he ""had it in his calendar.""

The DM said he couldn't ban the former shift supervisor because ""if we ban him from this store, we have to ban him from all the stores."" He said it could be cause for him to retaliate. Funny how every time I asked for measures to be exercised to protect me from this individual, it's considered to be retaliation. The DM told me I could present a restraining order to enact a ban. I then was gaslit for the duration of the conversation and told to ""trust the system.""

I wasn't necessarily shocked by his lack of accountability. In March of 2020, during the onset of COVID-19, I was working a shift, and we ran out of hot water. Our DM advised us to mix boiling water from the brewer with cold water and hand soap into a container we put iced coffee in to wash our hands. He told us to tell customers we couldn't serve food because ""the ovens were broken.""

Not only is our district manager a sexual predator sympathizer, but he's also a liar and prioritizes sales over workers' best interests. He's the dirty car salesman of coffee.

starbucks,"TW: S*xual Harrasment 

This month I quit my job at arguably the most successful coffee chain company, which I once embraced and fully loved. I worked there for just over 3.5 years. While there are multiple reasons that I decided to leave, I wanted to share my experience with reporting sexual harassment.

In February of 2021, two years into my employment at this company. A shift supervisor transferred to the store where I had worked since it opened. He ended up sexually harassing not only me but multiple female employees, including minors.

For a few months, I was in denial about the misconduct. However, many of my co-workers pointed out the ""special interest"" the shift supervisor had taken with me. Once it was shared with me that he had said borderline predatory comments to minors at my store, I decided enough was enough.

Initially, I was hesitant to speak out about the harassment because I knew the district manager, Dave Schuberth, favored him. They had weekly meetings about potentially making him an ASM.

I drafted a document outlining the harassment. I had close to fifteen of my fellow baristas who either experienced harassment or witnessed it sign their names. I presented it to my store manager, who then escalated it to Dave.

Bare minimum, I asked that this shift supervisor be transferred to another store, as he already covered shifts at other stores. I was told that it couldn't happen because it would be a form of retaliation against him.

From that point on, there was a corporate investigation for months. I continued working at the store, as did my harasser, our store manager scheduled us at different times to prevent overlap. Still, he would show up to work early or stay late due to understaffing, and he always ended up in my proximity. I often would have panic attacks before going into the store if I saw his car in the parking lot.

Weeks go by, and he makes a ""joke"" about ""punching me in the fucking face"" in front of another worker, and Dave suspends him.

starbucks,"I used to be a nanny to a couple tiny tots. I was with them for over a decade. And the older one, little girl, we‚Äôre gonna call her Alice for this story, loved y‚Äôall as much as I love my coffee. Her hot chocolate with extra sprinkles made her life complete. 

She was also terminally shy. Just an absolute wallflower who would wither away if anyone acknowledged her. It was a bit of a problem that her parents and I were working hard to help her with. She hated being so shy, she wanted independence, to be more vocal and outgoing. 

Well, I paired up with the local Starbucks that we went too far too often. Asked them when they were the least busy, and if we could maybe practice talking to the baristas - not even ordering, maybe just waving hello in a low pressure situation. 

I told the local store manager how wonderful everyone there was, and now I‚Äôm telling you. Those baristas were great. 

Alice waved to them? Extra, EXTRA sprinkles (with permission). 

First time Alice said hello? Damn straight she got a cookie. 

Within 6 months my girl was walking in, high diving her friends, the baristas, and ordering her own drink. Sometimes even one for her brother, definitely ordering for me.

starbucks,"Hi all,

I wonder if I can get some advice here. I typically get a nitro cold brew or regular cold brew daily. I like my cold brews with just a TINY bit of cream. Like literally a splash. The colour of the brew should be a chocolatey brown after the cream has been put in. 

My problem is that 9 times out of 10 the barista puts WAY too much and I shamefully have to ask them to make another. And when I say too much, I mean TOO MUCH. Like they hand me a fucking yellow-beige concoction and I‚Äôm like Jesus Christ here we go. 

I have tried using SO many different descriptions. I used to say ‚Äúcold brew with a splash of cream‚Äù but I realized that‚Äôs super subjective. How big of a splash?

Then I started saying ‚Äúcold brew with a TINY bit of cream in it‚Äù but they never really consistently get it right with that description either. I guess everyone has their own definition of tiny. 

So then one day as I was drinking a unusually perfect cold brew with the perfect amount of cream in it, I noticed on my cold brew cup‚Äôs sticker it said ‚Äú1/4 inch of cream‚Äù. Was this the secret???? Was this the key to getting the barista to using the right amount?

I went to a Starbucks the next day and placed my order - ‚Äúcold brew with 1 quarter inch of cream please‚Äù. The barista looked at me for a sec and went ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù  I repeated the order and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what you mean‚Äù. Wtffff

Anyone have any advice that doesn‚Äôt involve me having to take my own cream lol. And btw this is a Post COVID issue because none of the Starbucks in Canada leave their milk and cream out for customers to use anymore. Otherwise I‚Äôd just put it in myself. 

I‚Äôve had this issue at multiple Starbucks, drive thrus and inside. You have no idea how frustrating this is. To essentially play Russian roulette with my daily cold brew.

Looks like pretty standard ""we are re-inventing COMPANY "" fluff talk for the most part but if you actually read the article, you can see shits gonna hit the fan for you all.  

\-New cold bar proprietary system that cuts making a Frappuccino into a THIRD of the time..

\- Clover Vertica brewers  that stop the need to brew and rotate coffee.

\-New Cold Pressed Technology that gives instant cold brew.

\-Batch warming for sandwiches.

&amp;#x200B;

The best is that they say it will give you guys more time to connect with customers (lol) but these sound like MAJOR drops in the labor you guys are gonna get. You are removing the need for Front register to rotate coffee and make sandwiches on the regular. If they actually cut Frappuccino making into a third, you can say goodbye to ever having a cold bar support. Sounds like Starbucks is planning a 3 man team, maybe 4 if you are busy (just for Saturday tho). 3 openers come in, MAYBE a midday person, then 2 closers. Also lol they are gonna try and frame instant brew coffee as just as good as normal brewed.",So whats the general reaction to the reinvention plan Starbucks has announced?

starbucks,"I'm a really slow learner. I was hired on as a shift supervisor, so I had to learn barista stuff AND shift stuff straight off the bat. My trainer was awesome but there was just so much stuff I didn't learn. I feel like they threw everything at me and then only focused on teaching me money handling. 

It's been 2.5 months here and I feel like there's a lot I don't know still. Is it even worth it for me to keep trying? I feel like I'm annoying everyone with my slow learning. All the shifts and the SM seem like they're always annoyed with me and today one of them said ""you really need to be retrained. You're always leaving notes in MyDaily that you had a bad close. You're just...always struggling.""

It's like, yes some things are my fault, I'm not blameless. But I've had bad closes because people left me to do clean play when I've never done it before. Or leave me with not enough baristas. Or a customer orders 10 drinks right before close. Or I have to do front&amp;food, pastry pull AND food count all at once. 

All these staffing issues are blamed on my slow learning, or my ""lack of ability."" 

Is it even worth staying here? I just want to know a general consensus so I don't waste my time working my ass off doing my best when people don't see it. And they don't want to see it.",I'm a slow learner; should I even keep working here?

starbucks,"This month I quit my job at arguably the most successful coffee chain company, which I once embraced and fully loved. I worked there for just over 3.5 years. While there are multiple reasons that I decided to leave, I wanted to share my experience with reporting sexual harassment.


In February of 2021, two years into my employment at this company. A shift supervisor transferred to the store where I had worked since it opened. He ended up sexually harassing not only me but multiple female employees, including minors.

For a few months, I was in denial about the misconduct. However, many of my co-workers pointed out the ""special interest"" the shift supervisor had taken with me. Once it was shared with me that he had said borderline predatory comments to minors at my store, I decided enough was enough.

Initially, I was hesitant to speak out about the harassment because I knew the district manager, Dave Schuberth, favored him. They had weekly meetings about potentially making him an ASM.


I drafted a document outlining the harassment. I had close to fifteen of my fellow baristas who either experienced harassment or witnessed it sign their names. I presented it to my store manager, who then escalated it to Dave.

Bare minimum, I asked that this shift supervisor be transferred to another store, as he already covered shifts at other stores. I was told that it couldn't happen because it would be a form of retaliation against him.

From that point on, there was a corporate investigation for months. I continued working at the store, as did my harasser, our store manager scheduled us at different times to prevent overlap. Still, he would show up to work early or stay late due to understaffing, and he always ended up in my proximity. I often would have panic attacks before going into the store if I saw his car in the parking lot.

Weeks go by, and he makes a ""joke"" about ""punching me in the fucking face"" in front of another worker, and Dave suspends him.

Ultimately, I don't know the details of what happened post-suspension. I did receive a call saying my claims were found to be substantiated, but I wasn't told what that meant going forward. By late June 2021, he was no longer employed by the company. I found out when a barista told me he was seen dropping off his store key.

In October of 2021, I was told by a reputable source from another store that not only does this former shift supervisor frequent this store, he asked to be re-hired. I was under the impression that he was banned from the stores because I have seen bans implemented for much less.

Come December of 2021, while I'm working, the former supervisor comes in to pick up his tips and sees me and vice versa. My body immediately goes into fight or flight, and my co-workers are just as shocked. Essentially, I had a panic attack, started crying, and told my manager I was going home because I didn't feel safe.

Two months prior, I stepped down from the shift supervisor role because the stress negatively impacted me. On my last day as a shift supervisor, I was verbally and almost physically assaulted by a man in the cafe. I filed an incident report and texted my manager, and I had no choice but to finish my shift in tears. No one in management ever followed up with me about the assault. 

In January of 2022, I asked to set up a time to speak with my store manager and Dave about my concerns. Dave never gave me a solid time and ambushed me during my shift. We ended up having this conversation in the BOH, where other employees overheard, even though I said I wasn't prepared to have that conversation.

I talked about how my mental health was negatively impacted and how I wasn't happy about how the situation was handled. I said it didn't make sense to me that a former shift supervisor was able to come into the store that he was fired from for sexual misconduct. Dave told me he wasn't fired for those reasons but did not disclose why he was terminated. I also mentioned that management never followed up with me about my sexual harassment claim or the man in the cafe who assaulted me. Dave was adamant that he followed up with me because he ""had it in his calendar.""

Dave said he couldn't ban the former shift supervisor because ""if we ban him from this store, we have to ban him from all the stores."" He said it could be cause for him to retaliate. Funny how every time I asked for measures to be exercised to protect me from this individual, it's considered to be retaliation. Dave told me I could present a restraining order to enact a ban. I then was gaslit for the duration of the conversation and told to ""trust the system.""

I wasn't necessarily shocked by his lack of accountability. In March of 2020, during the onset of COVID-19, I was working a shift, and we ran out of hot water. Dave advised us to mix boiling water from the brewer with cold water and hand soap into a container we put iced coffee in to wash our hands. He told us to tell customers we couldn't serve food because ""the ovens were broken.""

Not only is Dave a sexual predator sympathizer, but he's also a liar and prioritizes sales over workers' best interests. He's the dirty car salesman of coffee.


Ultimately, I decided the job was destructive to my mental health. I made a grueling decision to quit, forfeiting two years left of my SCAP scholarship with ASU. I am now anticipating at-least three months of no health insurance as I wait for enrollment at my new job.
I started at 18 years old, trained over 15 baristas, opened two stores, built a rapport throughout the district, and was promoted to shift supervisor. I gave my literal blood, sweat, and tears to this place but was still treated poorly by management. This country has always upheld the reputations of predators, so at the time, it was very jarring to me that this progressive and value-driven company was no different.

The csomer proceeded to yell at ne over the intercom saying that, ""Why are you always out, you guys just never have anything anymore do you- it's your fault that you're always out."" I proceeded to tell her that we would be able to have oatmilk the next day since our deiveries come every night. But I offered other teas, or milks- on top of that I found out from some fellow partners that we did have Earl Grey, but when I told her I found some and I could just change the milk she went BALLISTIC. She started yelling at me saying, ""OHHH Well if you 'suddenly' found Earl Grey, maybe you can 'suddenly' find some oatmilk while you're at it.""

starbucks,"Hey y‚Äôall, barista trainer here having a bit of a struggle. My green bean that I‚Äôve been training almost had a panic attack today from the amount of people coaching them and breathing down their neck in the store. A shift even pulled them aside and talked to them for about 5 minutes about why they need them to stick on the front register and not pop into the back to grab syrups or ice, etc. A bar partner came to check in on an order my green bean was ringing up and, instead of helping them understand that you don‚Äôt press the add ice button for a iced triple espresso, decided it would be best if they reached over their shoulder and made the change to the drink on the POS themselves. 

More little coaching things went on throughout the day that basically overwhelmed my green bean. I feel like, as their trainer, if anyone has any concerns about things the green bean is doing wrong that those concerns should be brought to me and I can find a way to coach that to my green bean. Instead, I feel like the whole store is just taking it upon their shoulders to coach them each in their own way and it‚Äôs stressing my trainee out. Am I in the right?

The assistant ordered it with no whip, sugar free base (though strawberry part of it still has sugar so...) and a nondairy milk.

starbucks,"Hello Starbucks Reddit. Today I come with a major concern I've had ever since I started working at my college campus's store. So I started working at Starbucks in the summer, but bc of my class schedule and lack of transportation (I have to share the car with my mom and we almost always had the same shifts so it would be either one of us driving and the other taking a lyft, most of my shifts were midday so I couldn't take advantage of the free rides). Anyway. I had to quit to apply to my store on campus, and I honestly didn't want to, I loved my manager and everyone there.

I just started this past Monday, and... I don't want to sound like I'm a know-it-all but that store is so DISORGANIZED. There's a shift supervisor in training who doesn't know how to make Fraps and the rest of the closing shift she's just wiping the counters. There's no fixed positions. I thought it would be different when I came yesterday for the midday. There was no shift supervisor, my coworkers just said I do ""what's available"". So I went on the register. Mind you, I was pretty quick with all the orders and that usual long ass line of 20+ people was now 5 people waiting to get their order in. However, there were people waiting 10+ minutes to get their order, and I feel really bad bc the drinks are not standard made. To give you an example: they put the refreshers directly in the cup, no shaking, no nothing, NADA. And since our customers are college students they gotta take whatever bs they're served bc they got class or are in a rush to somewhere and can't bother stay longer to complain bc it already takes too long to get a matcha latte üóø

Listen, correct me if I'm wrong, but for refreshers you put all the contents in the shaker, and shake. Not put the stuff in the cup then put it in the shaker (which they did... sometimes, very few times actually). Another thing... they don't sequence. People saw me deliver 3 drinks at once, they were giving drinks 1 at a time... üóø so no wonder why people always complain that the line takes too long. 

Next, the closing shift on Monday was too long. We should have been able to have everything clean by 10/10:30, just ring some last orders and close at 11. But because no one is delegated any task, people just do what they think they should do. No one has done the cabinets, and yesterday I felt bad bc one of the supervisors (for the food stations on campus) came to order some drinks and pointed out that our registers were dusty... Tell me how we got 4+ baristaa doing drinks and we still have a long ass line (we don't even have a drive thru, thank God bc with how things are run, that would be my 13th reason). The manager knew I had worked for Starbucks in the summer, and it feels like I'm the most experienced in that store (but to put it into perspective I've only worked at Starbucks for 2 months, some of thess people have been working at the campus store for years... I'm trying to meet with the manager and express my concerns but before I do I want to make sure I am in the right here, and if you could advice me how to go over these issues without it sounding like ""I know better, I should run the store"" bc no, I don't know better, I'm just doing  part time, and I won't offer to be a shift supervisor bc I know that takes training and weekly meetings which I would probably not be able to go to with how packed my schedule is (I'm studying to be a teacher and I have to do in-person observations for my courses, add the clubs I'm in, and the other classes, I barely make time to work and study). 

There is a lot of other stuff too I could mention, like how everyone leaves the milks outside the fridge and without the cap... I'm not joking, I've had to ask for 2% milk 10+ times during each shift I've been so far. Bc they keep moving it around, because no one restocks until were fully out of the last bottle of milk... like I said, I'm honestly really stressed by this situation and I wonder what I can do or what the manager can do to fix this. Idk what the training is for the new S.S. but she doesn't even know her Fraps, she's very sweet with me, and again none of this is personal but I can't just put a blind eye to the fact that this store is running by the grace of God or smth bc if it was an actual store I bet Karens would have drowned it and put it to rest.",Venti rant about my (college campus) store

starbucks,"Shares of Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) ticked up 2.46% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the coffee giant gave financial and business updates during its Investor Day event.

Store Growth: Starbucks now sees comparable store sales growth to be 7% to 9% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025, which is up from the range of 4% to 5%. There will be outsized comparable store sales in China due to the pandemic lockdowns.

Revenue: The company expects revenue growth between 10% to 12% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025. This includes earnings growth between 15% to 20%, which is up from 10% to 12%.

Business Plans: Starbucks sees this growth as a result of its newly announced $450 million investment in U.S. stores between 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, the company also rolled out a new partnership with DoorDash (NYSE: DASH) on Tuesday.

Stock Price: These improvements are needed to turn around the company. The stock price is down 24% this year.

Final Thoughts: Investors should be excited about these plans. New CEO Laxman Narasimhan starts his role on October 1.

starbucks,"I‚Äôm a trans partner that has a surgery date set months ago for the end of this month, only waiting on my Starbucks advocate to process it on their end for my surgeon‚Äôs office to clear it and move on to the next step, only to find that they won‚Äôt approve it at the very last minute, each time I called in there was a different excuse. 

First, benefits are changing in October, so it had to be done before then. So, I found a surgeon willing to do it before then. 

Then, I find out that while on a medical leave from another surgery I was recovering from, they cancelled my insurances due to unpaid premiums at the literal earliest possible moment (end of June, my last worked month). My disability payments through Sedgewick were nearly 2 months late, leaving me unable to pay the premiums, but also unable to pick up my HRT. My return to work date was Aug. 22 or so, but I was put on a new unapproved LOA by accident by sedgewick. I finally get through to the benefits center to reinstate my policies, but it takes FOREVER and I keep getting tossed back and forth for days, despite calling in as early as possible.

Then, my advocate tells me that I still haven‚Äôt paid my premiums (which I did, and correct them) and then they say that was a mistake but it‚Äôs still too late because TODAY coincidentally they are given the order to refuse all surgeries, so my FFS isn‚Äôt going to be covered at all. 

tl;dr a series of mistakes on their end results in me coincidentally being delayed over and over for weeks until TODAY they randomly with no warning decide they won‚Äôt cover anything for the rest of the month. Now what do I do? It seems so unfair; I did EVERYTHING I could and this was my entire life.",Advice involving insurance?

starbucks,"So I've been working at Starbucks for about 4 or 5 months now and I'm constantly having to sit down and get talked down to by my manager. In the past couple of months I've had problem on top of problem on top of problem happening at home regarding family and the death of my pet. 
My manager always has something to say about my attitude or the way I come into work or how I work.
I work opening shifts and before this job I've never had to wake up that early before. I was always getting up at 9 am rather than 4 am in the morning.
Recently she's said this:
1. When I come into work, even if im tired and mentally/emotionally exhausted, I should greet all of my coworkers and say good morning and get right to work.
2. I can't do dishes during peak (which I haven't done for the past 2 weeks. I'm trying not to piss anyone off and just stay out on the floor as much as possible)
3. I have to stop being disrespectful to my shift leaders. ( everyone assumes I'm being disrespectful when I forget to acknowledge them when they ask me to do something. Usually during peak. I get so stressed out I forget to tap the headset to acknowledge them. Sometimes I even forget to put my headset back on as our front/CS because I'm constantly taking orders up front and forget to put it back on.)
4. No drinks on the floor. I usually just drink water but sometimes when we get a second rush and I just made a drink for myself, I don't have time to run it back there. Or I'm so cold in the mornings now that I ask if it's okay for me to just drink a hot tea. My shifts usually tell me it's fine and I don't have any other drinks out. 

To put it basically, I'm told we're supposed to be a team and I need to be here for my team and tough things out, but I have so much going on that I feel like I've got no one to really speak to about my issues. Toughing it out, is exactly what I've been doing and it's not enough anymore. I feel like I'm being told to push every emotion aside and only have a smile/chipper attitude while I'm working, even with my coworkers. They always have something to complain about when it comes to me. Everything I do isn't good enough I feel like.

TLDR: My performance at work/attitude is never good enough for my manager/shift leaders no matter how hard I try to be positive despite everything I recently have piled on my plate outside of work.",Are baristas supposed to be robots?

I find myself in a bit of a pickle, so if anyone can help me out, it would be very much appreciated. I need to give my notice asap, because something unexpected has happened and I can‚Äôt keep on working for the company, even though I want to leave on good terms.

The situation here is that I‚Äôve been working for the company for a year, but as a shift I still haven‚Äôt finished my probation period (3 months) which ends in 2 weeks time. I‚Äôve been reading the contract and all the booklets they give you when you are hired, and I find it to be quite confusing.

I thought it might be helpful to compile some Barista knowledge on how to make this annoying multistep darling drink easier to make, with less running around. I saw an absolute mad scientist-level Barista here suggest just steaming the water and lemonade together. Mastrena don't care what liquid you're steaming -- it's all getting to 160!

I've personally tried this trick and love the hell out of it. It's more consistent with less hot water eyeballing, and it also enables you (depending on your store setup) to keep all of the product needed to make this around the bar area. 

If you run out of honey blend and you have to use packets, you can keep your honey packets on top of your machine. The heat it naturally produces will help liquify them. Finally, I make something called ""scissor tea."" If the scissors get sticky, I just put them in a cup of hot water and they're cleaned and sanitized in one quick step.

What is the right way to do half day requests?

As a coffee neophyte who did not mind bitter drinks, my choice in the 2000s was a grande dark roast with a maple oat scone.

But yesterday I met my life partner, based on the advice of a Reddit post: The iced shaken expresso with 2 percent milk and brown sugar. At first it was awkward, but that first sip convinced me my lips and tastebuds were meant to touch this drink. We spent hours together contemplating spreadsheets and inane bureaucratic processes.

starbucks,"Today I went out to work at a store I've never been to. I was having lots of anxiety as the people their seemed very standoffish and unwelcoming when I got there and the shift was very unhelpful. It was a rough first few hours getting used to a different store layout, but then a new shift gets on the floor. New shift is very welcoming and helpful, really helped me feel more comfortable on a new floor and helped me relax and find my flow. Afternoon rolls in and I'm now in the window. I go to grab something and new shift hands drink to customer out the window. Lady in her car asks something about me and misgenders me. New shift corrects the customer on my pronouns for me. I never told them my pronouns, they had looked before hand in the system and already knew them. Probably one of the most validating things anybody has ever done for me... Customer then asks my shift to talk to me, so I lean out the window and ask what I can do for her. This lady then hands me a card and I go to grab it. She's holding onto it extra tight so I can't even take it. She then deadpan stares at me and says ""I think you need this"". I just say thank you and finally pull the card from her hand and tell her to have a nice day. The card is a Welcome Jesus into Your Life card. This really bummed me out, but new shift says I handled situation well and then revalidates my pronouns just to make sure they didn't use the wrong ones and gives me some words of support. Probably would have cried if new shift wasn't so nice.

Point of my story: Please welcome new and borrowed partners and communicate with them as it really makes a huge difference. Also, at my normal store a lot of my co workers and even store manager will misgender me. I already have extreme dysphoria and struggle constantly, please lookout and use the correct pronouns for partners, we will respect you 110% for it as well as appreciate the validation and respect more than anything.

We made her drinks to how she asked and then she started saying this and that about how she wanted other things added, and to ‚Äúmake the moment right‚Äù our barista on DT complied. The last thing she asked for was for us to ADD DRAGONFRUIT INCLUSIONS TO A PASSION DRINK AFTER IT WAS ALMOST MADE AND COLF FOAM WAS ALREADY ADDED TO THE TOP (a few of her drinks were refreshers with cold foam) so they slid the drink to me to put dragonfruit on top, so I just stuck two scoops on top of the cold foam. The shift commended me for not actually reshaking the refresher because we all had headaches from how the customer had acted about the other drinks being incorrect despite them being made to how she ordered them. i guess what made that drink stick in my mind was how she wanted dragon fruit added and was rude about it to our DTR who wasn‚Äôt making drinks or taking orders, yet she had not requested or paid for the inclusions in the order at the speaker.",Drive Thru Mess
starbucks,"Guys, I really don't know how much longer I can do this.

For the past twelve weeks (since July) I've been the ONLY supervisor scheduled almost every Sunday. Open to close, both food counts, either placing the order or putting away the delivery, and running the shift with half the staff we need for weekend traffic, having to send half the team on break at the same time just to keep up, all in just eight hours, and then I hear that the other supervisors complain about how bad the closes are as if I can do anything about it (my weekday closes are perfect, by the way). 

I've been on vacation for two weeks and my manager assured me that the two new supervisors he hired would be done their training by the time I get back and I could have Sundays off for a few months. But when I checked the daily coverage report for the week I return, sure enough it's the skeleton crew on Sunday again. It's the day after my birthday, too - some birthday present this is! Also, mobile order and pay is going to launch before I return (my store is in Quebec) and I don't trust my DM to turn it off in spite of me never having run this shift with MO&amp;P active before.

I'm a barista trainer, a shift supervisor, a coffee master, I won the district barista championship twice, I'm applying to be an asm. I can taste the difference between a shaken drink and a nonshaken drink, and I do like enforcing the Starbucks standard to shake drinks (refreshers, teas, espressos, y'know.) not because I hate the people I correct, but I feel bad for customers who pay for and expect a drink to be made right and its not. refreshers taste different. I make myself an unshaken refresher after work because I'm lazy and I get disappointed that I didn't shake it because the bottom is too sweet and warm, and the top is all water and cold. not to mention, shaking the drinks cuts down on the ""well the other store shakes it and it tastes better"" or ""this tastes wrong, do it again"" complaints if we just do it right the first time.

but. every time someone orders a ""veentay brown milk shaken sugar oatmeal expresso drink"" with ""no ice, I try asking for light ice but you always put way too much so I guess I'll just get no ice"" because they want to drink a big cup of milk, I'm not shaking it. the pressure from the steam fills the shaker, the lid pops off, it burns me, makes a mess, theres no point. without ice, the flavor doesn't change. you get 4 espresso shots, a shake of cinnamon, some brown sugar and 26 ounces of oat milk. that's over half a carton of oat milk!!! there is no way their stomachs don't hurt after drinking that much milk.

This particular one I‚Äôm not sure if I can call ‚Äúnegative‚Äù, it was more baffling than anything else.

starbucks,"Got a new manager recently and we had our 1on 1 yesterday. My take away is that he's the type to just give in to customer demands because ""We don't get paid enough to enforce the rules"" and he can't really be bothered. My issue here is that this ultimately affects all of us. As it is we already have customers constantly trying to side step our boundaries and the few ""rules"" we do have. I think having healthy boundaries helps everyone, it creates product consistency, empowers baristas and is respectful of all of our partners. If we just spoil our customers they will go to other stores and then we're the ""other"" Starbucks that will do whatever they want. The customers then take it out on the innocent barista trying to follow standard and that negatively impacts that partner. I feel ultimately that it's more respectful to my coworkers (literally all partners) to just follow standard and occasionally say no to outrageous requests or behavior.

Our store is severely understaffed right now. We also have a new out hired manager who is not qualified for this job.
Yesterday I asked to come in a bit later than 7am (which was my scheduled time) because I was having severe back pain from working 7 days straight, having one day off, then working 6 straight days again. (Also I was not asked if I was able to be scheduled that much, they just did it without making sure it was ok with me or the 2 other SSVs it‚Äôs happened to)

(I have been working in the food service industry for 12+ years now. I always let my management know about my back. I even let my district manager know.)

I was told I can‚Äôt come in late because 2 other people called off, and it was just my manager and a trainee working. I ended up calling out because I told both my manager and my DM that I am uncomfortable working such short staffed with this back pain and would be risking hurting myself more and calling out if I really threw my back out and missing more work than necessary. These flare ups happen two to three times a year, and again, they know. I have never called out for it before as I started working here last November. 
My DM wanted to fire me for it, but my SM ended up fighting for me and I got written up instead.

This has been hurting me for about a week, and last Thursday I was very vocal about my pain but did not ask to go home or leave early, but genuinely felt unsupported by the other staff working and strained my back even more. 

Basically my question is, am I able to fight a write up? I was trying to get transferred because this store is chaotic and it‚Äôs just too much. Also was supposed to start the ASM program but now can‚Äôt for 6 months. Is there a way to fight this or am I SOL?",Written up for having a pre-existing condition

starbucks,"I had a lady come thru dt last night and I‚Äôm still not over it.

I tell her I‚Äôve never heard of it, if it‚Äôs a TikTok drink she‚Äôll need to give me the recipe. I can tell she‚Äôs rolling her eyes at me thru the camera, she starts rattling it off and she asks for ‚Äòlight frozen water cubes‚Äô Y‚Äôall I was so thrown. I asked her to repeat it, and then when I was like ‚Äòyou mean ice?‚Äô she was all ‚Äòugh I guess‚Äô and then ordered another TikTok drink. She had such an awful attitude the entire transaction.

starbucks,"I‚Äôm sure everyone here knows about all the popular tiktok drinks‚Ä¶ under the sea refresher, iced white mocha with sccf and caramel drizzle, vanilla bean frap with dragonfruit pieces to name a few

Most of the drinks made on tiktok are well within our capacity to make (given if we have the ingredients) but there are a good amount of baristas on tiktok creating drinks that are either against policy or are just downright COMPLICATED

I‚Äôm talking the hello kitty frap, that one trend where they wanted us to put literal CAKE POPS in the drinks, asking us to put their own bananas in the blenders???? Yes there are drinks we can make that are complicated, but has anyone noticed that the baristas making those videos are taking their time? That they‚Äôre not being rushed, or possibly have other drinks they need to make after it? Or they don‚Äôt have customers glaring at them?

Those complicated drinks take time to make, and if it‚Äôs 7am on a Monday, that time to make the drink has to be cut in half because of how many other drinks need to be made after it

around 11 we run out of ice. like none, we‚Äôre telling people sorry we‚Äôre out of ice and i send someone to get more but they‚Äôre going to the store so it‚Äôs gonna be a second. my sm turns off mobiles (thank god bc we were DROWING). 

ice arrives and then the drive thru screen breaks for the second time today! first time it just became unplugged so whatever but this time like fully broken she won‚Äôt turn back on or anything. we close drive and i call, solid 30 mins later we get it working and now our drive thru window is having problems! she just opening when nothing it making that happen so i submit a ticket.

starbucks,"hey ya'll. first off, I wanna say that I strongly support the union movement. I am so here for it. I appreciate and admire everything you guys are doing. 

I had a borrowed partner at my store today; they were from a unionized store and they were helping us out because we have a lot of sick partners right now. we aren't unionized. our store is busy af ($9000+/day) but we have an amazing manager and we are in a good place. it was super kind of that partner to come and help us out on a Sunday.

however. when you come help as a borrowed partner and then start to point out to me (the keyholder), my manager, and anyone else who will listen what is ""wrong"" with our store, you are not doing a good thing. you are not making a good impression. you are hurting the union movement. 

PLEASE REMEMBER that to these nonunionized partners, you are the face, the EMBODIMENT of the union movement (ESPECIALLY if you are wearing sbux workers united pins, etc). some of them have probably never met anyone, let alone worked with anyone, from a unionized store. we must lead by example to show people the way, and criticizing their workplace organization/tasking structure/etc the first time you work there is rude and inconsiderate. several of my partners approached me after the borrowed partner left to explain their frustration around this situation. 

this kinda goes for any partners helping out at other stores. you mold to what that store does for the time that you're there. if you don't like that, don't work at other stores.

today I'm working mid, and i came in with one person as ssv (who also sucks but not the point) and in the middle of my shift, he came in and the other ssv left.

Because the customer ordered a drink that came out to $7.00 USD after the mods they had requested ‚Äî because the customer was too lazy to look up the price on the website or app before ordering, and because they‚Äôre ignorant or unwilling to learn that it‚Äôs CORPORATE, not the baristas that are setting these prices.  

I will never understand what crawls up someone‚Äôs ass and dies, and makes them come into a place of business... then have the audacity treat &amp; speak to the workers like they‚Äôre literal garbage, whether something is the workers‚Äô fault or not.   

Even if the drink that YOU as a customer insist on having 85 mods to &amp; barista accidentally forgets one, or you don‚Äôt like the price because you‚Äôre too stupid or lazy to look up the prices, you have zero right to take it upon yourself to speak to another human being like they‚Äôre literal garbage and deserve to be your verbal punching bag.   They are human beings, just like YOU as the customer, and under zero circumstances is it okay to treat them with anything less than kindness and respect.   

And if at ANY point you feel that treating another human being who is serving you like garbage &amp; like they deserve to be scream at and cussed at, then I have one piece of advice for you.   It is a sage piece of advice that I have used for years when I feel like I am about to lose my shit on someone who absolutely does not deserve it for things that are beyond their control.   You have absolutely got to step back and say to yourself in a REALLY firm, almost snappy voice because you deserve it, ‚ÄúBE FUCKING NICE!!‚Äù    Trust me, it is MUCH more effective for both of you, and it will get you much further.  It would also cause your entitle ass not to scream at your servers &amp; baristas and make them feel less than, or ruining their entire day because your stupid ass drink ‚Äúisn‚Äôt made correctly‚Äù or made up to your ‚Äústandards‚Äù.  Another way to look at it, is that if you‚Äôre being a complete asshole to your server/barista, they‚Äôre going to be A LOT less willing (mentally and motivationally) to help you, because you have already taken everything out of them over to your screamfest temper tantrum.  

I left a job because of customers like that, who thought they were free to talk to me like I was literal garbage as soon as I said something relevant to their claim they didn‚Äôt like, or that the policy didn‚Äôt cover them for this, that, or the other.  Customers that would raise their voices at me, swear at me, make threats to me, and behave like an uncivilized human being.

starbucks,"Hi. So I went to one starbucks and got my usual iced chai latte, but was thrown off because it was light and tasted just milky. 

Went to another starbucks up the rod (yay for so many so close together) and tried getting another iced chai. This one was even lighter in color and I couldn‚Äôt taste any chai, only milk. I decided enough and went back to that starbucks and said something seemed off (thinking it was either a recipe change, someone forgot to put enough pumps, etc) 

The girl was like ‚Äúohh you must‚Äôve been the last chai order we accepted. we got a bad batch, and tried to get some more from another store but it was also a bad batch‚Äù

I asked what she meant by bad batch and she said that it is just really weak/diluted tasting and must‚Äôve slipped through whatever quality control. And hopefully they‚Äôll get a good batch in soon.

I was wondering if I could ask for advice regarding a recurring issue with my mobile orders, which has occurred a handful of times now at multiple stores.  Specifically, I have ordered drinks that I have assumed will be hot -- usually lattes or macchiatos from the ""hot coffees"" or ""hot teas"" sections of the online menu -- and then when I arrive for pickup, they are iced.  I don't say anything because it seems a bit much to ask for someone to dump it out and make a different drink.  However, I'm wondering if there's anything I can do in the future to help make my preferences clearer in the mobile orders.

starbucks,"I‚Äôve been with the siren for about three months now and I‚Äôm just now getting backlash for how I run warming when I‚Äôm there. When a food ticket prints, I stick it onto the top part of the metal holder where the bags/plasticware are. This is so when the food has more than one item I can visualize when to put each item in and it gives me an idea for how many more there are to go. This is also so I can stick the ticket onto the bag when the food is in the oven and place any necessary items into the bag. The bags in the holders are packed so in a rush I still have to pull the bag slower or they will all fly everywhere.

Apparently we should be immediately putting the tickets onto bags, which isn‚Äôt a problem until there is a food rush. All of the bags can‚Äôt fit onto the small counter for larger food orders, I end up throwing the wrong food into the oven/not throwing 2 items of the same thing because they printed at different times, and it takes more time overall.

starbucks,"Hey, I'm hoping some of you can provide some insight.

I applied to a Starbucks and was hired as a barista. A month ago.

I still haven't filled out my forms for employee info or joined the Starbucks partner app. My first shift is scheduled for September 20th and no word on what time I'm supposed to be there. I don't have my schedule.

I contacted the store manager already to ask when I would receive my schedule, and the response was when its finalized (this was about 2.5 weeks ago). 

I'm getting very stressed out as I need a schedule so I can prepare to work around school, and also to make sure my other job won't overlap with the time of my first shift. Has anyone else had this experience or could it just be the management at this location?

So, I quit. I was not the only person who quit abruptly, and I was one of 6/7 people who had reported problems with our new manager to our dm. I know for a fact that my name was not flagged in the system because I checked- so I am allowed to be rehired. 

I had an interview the other day in a district close to my old one (I actually know this district manager as well, and we have previously had a good relationship because she used to be the DM for my old store). The manager was really excited and told me that she wanted to hire me. Since she had blocked off time in the next schedule for someone to train, she wanted me to start next week. She explained during the interview that some of her partners were trying to unionize, so she was fully aware of this already. I wasn't worried about the situation because was friends with a lot of the same people who had worked with this manager in the past. 

I got a call today from this manager saying that she was sorry, but she was more limited in her hiring capabilities than she previously thought because of the union stuff at her store.

starbucks,"I do not care about Starbucks. I do not think most of the stuff we sell is any good, and absolutely none of it is worth what they charge. When someone is doing a hack to save money I am not being robbed. But let me tell you why I care about standards. 

I care about standards because this is a big chain with many locations in each geographical area. That means most customers visit more than one Starbucks in their area. They might have a regular store they visit, but maybe also one by work or one by the shopping center or whatever. 

I do not care about the customer's experience. I do not care that it is consistent. This is not why I care about standards. 

What I care about is the customer's *expectations*, and how that can impact my fellow workers at stores that are not my own. Now the customer, you must understand, is a low-intelligence, high-demand creature, one that lives largely on sugars and foams. These customers, little more than feral sugar pursuers, do not know what is in their drinks, do not know how their drinks are made, do not usually even know the actual names of their drinks. But what they do know is that if one store lets them make a fake latte by getting two shots in a grande cup, light ice, fill it with half and half, they will come to expect that. What they do know is that if one store lets them get their Americano in a trenta cup, they will expect that. 

Now, when that customer heads to another store, a store where perhaps the employees stick to standards, that customer will - more likely than not! - become a monstrous pain in the ass to the low-paid worker who is just trying to make a drink the way they were taught to make a drink. 

What this means is that a barista at location A, by training their customers that they can get whatever they want however they want, is making the life of a barista at location B much, much harder. 

Standards supposedly exist to give customers a standard experience across all stores, but for me they exist to protect my fellow workers - they are the ones who will bear the brunt of the fury of the monster I create when I break standards for a customer. My greatest fear is becoming the person the customer is talking about when they say ""the other Starbucks does it for me all the time."" I never want to be the other Starbucks.

starbucks,"I have been trying to transfer stores for six months now. My SM and DM had been making the process and my life at my store absolute hell, and I believe it‚Äôs due to my involvement in union efforts in the area. I am also on the spectrum and have ADHD, and they have been refusing to accommodate me and making my working conditions worse.

I called out a couple weeks ago due to some mental health scares, and was written up for it. I asked why I was being written up, when no one else was when they called out, and they refused to answer. This was the final straw in a long list of incidents. 

My DM came into the store, for the first time since she fired the main union organizer at our store (who was also my best friend). She sat me down and told me they were holding off on my transfer AGAIN, this time because of the write up. This was the forth time overall that my transfer had been pushed back. I then went off on her. For holding me to different standards. For lack of communication. For union busting and for ableism. She tried to gaslight me and I shut that down immediately and told her I shouldn‚Äôt have to teach an adult woman how to communicate respectfully. I told her that if I wasn‚Äôt being transferred that she could consider this my resignation. 

DM: ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre putting in your two weeks?‚Äù

I haven't ordered a frap in some years due to it being a fear food, and I've sorta challenged myself to get one.

*How they think we can work at a fast food restaurant pace but offer handcrafted beverages and have high customer connection scores.  

*How are we are supposed to not get burnt out because of the unrealistic expectations put on us while working with product outages and ridiculous customer drink modifications.  

* How we are supposed to take breaks if customers come first and if we can't get to our lunch break are questioned why and told it must be our time management issue even when we had call offs and machines breaking down.  *sigh*

There are donuts to keep track of and sandwich recipes to remember on top of drinks, at least at Sbux you guys have drinks and toss food items in the oven.

Had a lady hold up the drive through and get mad today because I made one of my partners have her tell us what the recipe was for a cotton candy frappuccino. I had partners looking at me like I was crazy because several of us knew what it was and could make it, no problem. 

And if you're annoyed at me too, then you're part of the problem. I'm protecting our green beans, and I'm protecting those that just don't know. The minute you say ""oh, I can make that for you, of course"" you're making that customer think it's a drink on the actual menu. And then situations like today arise. 

""well the last time I came here they knew how to make it, and I didn't have to go to all this trouble. This is stupid.""

That is the reaction it breeds when someone new doesn't know what they're talking about. And it might make me petty or just a bad ssv, but I make every barista stick to their guns and ask every single time, no matter if they know it or not. People need to stop coming in and ordering a chocolate covered strawberry, or a captain crunch.

First, I would like to say sorry for my language and tone in this,   
It is 12:19 AM as of now, and my blood has been boiling.   


Our payday was friday of last week,   
I had just finished training and, me and my manger came to the conclusion my DOB was entered wrong, however he assured me that wasn't a issue, and we moved on.   
Now, that was fixed, then on friday, my check never went into my bank account. After I messaged him about this, he told me he would take time and look into it in the coming morning. Now 2 days later, I text him back about it, and he finally responded saying to log into our work computer to go to the partner hub. I attempted to log in and after attempting a password reset upon login, it said ""Invalid PB1085 ID"" or something like that, that isn't exactly what it said but somewhat close.  


Then we hung up and he said he would have to fix it, got a text about sending him a picture of my ID and said everything should be fixed.   


Now it was labor day weekend so that didn't help in reliving my stress. So I was told I would have to wait till Monday (Labor Day) for him to file a emergency Pay out. He said it would take 1-2 processing days, (another kick to my side)   
So yesterday it was supposed to be in my bank. I use Navy Federal Credit Union so I get my check a day early. So that was the next kick yesterday at 12AM. I have been up the past nights waiting and seeing and it is driving me fuckin crazy. My blood is boiling, I have been busting my ass trying to work hard and long.   


Now it is Thursday, 12:26 of this week, and I have not received my check.   
Thoughts? Am I wrong to be incredibly frustrated? Like legit blood boiling. If I dont see a check by like 8 or so I feel as if I need to demand a physical check, im at my limit.

This time i put like 2 of 3 ice cubes in it, shook it up then handed it to her, but then she freaks the heck out over the foam in her drinks saying its too much! and she starts being really rude, talking loudly where other customers in the grocery store could hear and I just felt my anxiety spike, i started shaking really bad though i tried to control it. i literally almost walked out &amp; cried bc there was no need to be that mad and yell at me when you see im the only one there and im new (well not really anymore). the third time, it was finally fine and she didnt say anything but i still felt hurt a bit.

Back then, I felt so inspired and enthusiastic during my first few weeks of working. Old co-workers were so nice and customers clearly have patience with me. With practice, I become better at everything. Not gonna lie, I learned a lot. But ever since then, things felt so different. Every day I walked in, it was literally peak period. There were aggressive customers who rang mad-modification drinks, I even felt super bad for making their over-sugared drinks for them. Although there were some regulars and partners that warmed my heart, all of them had left sadly. Literally every week I will see a new face smh. I am cool with new people joining our community, but our store is so busy. And clearly, they are not ready for such tasks. So all my shifts just have to put me on the bar. I was lucky enough that I even had done hot bar, cold bar, and mobile bar as a continuous rotation throughout the same shift.

Once in a long while, my coworkers will text me to do a check-in and see how life is going, but now, they only texted me when they want their shift covered or help because people called out. Because of that, I lost all my faith in everyone and became anti-social when I was working. There was also some tea like I secretly know one of the partners romantically liked me (I am just 20 and I have school;-;).

starbucks,,New Hit Modification to ask Your Barista for
starbucks,"Hello baristas, I have a question to ask of those of you who have been at stores for a while and seen new partners come and go. I am a fairly new hire (beginning of last month) and was hired at the same time as another girl. There were two other new hires before us, and there have been two since.

My manager has made comments a few times that I am falling behind the other girl, even having her ""supervise"" me making drinks. We work very similar hours, but usually different shifts, so technically, we should both be getting bar practice. But it does not seem to be the manager's priority to give me any, putting me on bar for 10-20 minutes in a 4 hours shift before sending me to clean bathrooms, hand out on drive or do customer support. My supervisors and manager are VERY strict about the plays and roles, so it's not like I can ask them to put me on bar longer.  

When we were finishing training, our trainer told us that we wouldn't get much time on bar for the first few weeks as the previous two newbies needed that time. But now that the two new hires are out of the training modules and in the bar, the supervisor has been putting them on bar over me again, so I am still not getting practice.

It is beginning to make me wonder if they have already decided that they are going to fire me once the new people are trained. The jobs that they put me on need very little training, and it feels like they are just keeping me around as a helper until they can replace me with someone else. On top of that, I am not being given enough hours (no weekends despite being available) to reach benefits, which makes me even more suspicious that they aren't bothering to put that much effort into me because I won't be around long.

Do you think I am reading too much into these behaviors, or have you seen something similar happen before with a new hire? I just keep waiting for the play caller to put me on bar, but it never comes. I'm beginning to feel a bit discouraged with the whole situation.

Thanks for any feedback you can give me!",Am I being replaced?

starbucks,"
I've had 4 managers in the months I've worked for a licensed store. The third one wasn't really a manager but was the one with seniority. She only opened and never closes, i switch from open to mid to closer depending on weeks. Whenever anything went wrong she would blame me, even if it wasn't my fault. She was ""nice"" before being put in the position. About halfway into her being ""manager"" she told me that I have been clocking off, without doing anything before leaving, like leaving mid rush or not making sure I take the trash out. Even though I'm not able to take trash.

I had told her, I understood her concerns but I also explained that I need to clock off when I'm off because we aren't allowed overtime and get a meeting with the boss if we do so often and ill try to do better, plus I'm not allowed to do trash because of reasons. I also said this has happened to me before with other ppl and asked if this is a issue that needs to be brought up to managers now?? She had told me that I need to comunicate with the other baristas and not to bring anything up with managers or management and if I do, she'll tell our bosses and that I don't do anything during my shifts. 

Even now when she's not manager she tell me, it's not hard to do simple things or that I half-a$$ everything or don't do anything correctly. She is leaving in month, should I say something to her about this treatment or should I just wait it out???

starbucks,"Portland Oregon FWIW. 
So I'm like 1.5 months on board, past training, and have been taught closing. I'm kind of frustrated because I am available all day 5 days a week, 6 coming soon. This said, store manager is still bringing in new hires and I just heard today they are looking for an opener. I only get scheduled 28 hours a week. I have mentioned in the nicest ways that I would live longer shifts. 

When I covered for someone:
""Hey I *really* appreciated the longer shift."" in a text. 

When a customer asked if they were hiring and I heard about the opener shift, once they left I said:
""Feel free to train me and I'd love to do it.""

At the end of closing today I told my SM a third time:
""I would really love to work longer hours,"" which got a silent smile and nod.

When I applied and interviewed for this job I said I was looking for as much of a full time schedule as possible. I take every opportunity to cover for people. I have had no complaints and when I asked how I was doing after initial training I was told I am above average for a new person. Since then, I can work bars, CS, Customer Support, planted or not. I might ask one question a day about a drink I haven't heard of or a specialty order.

...Yet we are bringing on 2 kids not old enough to work a full week by law, just finished training one before them, and apparently we need an opener.

I want large shifts, 8 hour shifts / 40 a week or as close as possible. What should I do? At this point I feel like I'm a bother by bringing it up.

The only thing I considered was that the SM told me at hiring that they try to keep people in training under 6 hours, but I'm not getting trained anymore. There are a few modules to do that are very obscure and SM hasn't made time for (due today actually). But I was also told that, as a person who wants Starbucks health insurance, that the store prioritizes hours for those people. Right now I'm going to *narrowly* make the 3 month consecutive hours to obtain insurance.

Advice? I've been so direct to SM. When you make 15.50 an hour I don't get why we need sooooo many people. I'm here, I'm available, I've made it known. Everyone likes me. Do I share my interest with the district manager at this point? The only thing close to an acknowledgement my SM was after I told them I'd be available for an extra day come October, to which they replied, ""Awesome! We need people on those days."" I don't get it.

Thanks.",What's keeping me from getting longer shifts?

starbucks,"Longtime Starbucks drinker here...well, long-time, but infrequent. I only occasionally get a Frappuchino or Cold Brew, but my favorite drink has been the Caramel Iced Macchiato. Well, it used to be, but ever since they started serving them in those straw-less cups, drinking one has been an existential nightmare.

I was reminded of this today when I got that new Apple Crisp Iced Macchiato. Delicious, except the lack of a straw made it subpar. One of the things I love about some Starbucks drinks is how layered they are, something relatively unique among most coffee places. Having a straw lets you experience each layer as you desire. This is doubly true for anything with caramel or other heavy sauce in it, since it sinks to the bottom. You can use the straw to get a little bit of sweet syrupy goodness into your sip whenever you feel like it.

Except with these (relatively) new cups, that's a thing of the past. You don't get to experience the layers, you just chug the espresso part until you get to the milk, unless of course you shake the whole thing until it becomes a completely different drink. And forget about tasting any of that syrup, it's gonna stick to the bottom of the cup the whole way through.

I literally never get these drinks on the go anymore, I can only have them when I've gotten home, and can use a spoon or something to experience each layer, and I don't to explain to anyone why that's a miserable experience. 

Surely, I can't be the only one who thinks the lack of a straw is ruining these drinks?",Not getting a straw-cup for drinks like an Ice Macchiato is criminal

I‚Äôm a rehire. I have a lot of experience in licensed stores and even managed my own brick-and-mortar drive licensed drive through for awhile. I was a trainer too back in the day. I eventually left to pursue an independent coffee career and worked for a third wave coffee shop. It was the best job I‚Äôve ever had- so fulfilling and I learned so much about my craft and passion. I recently moved to a small northern town with my partner and it was hard leaving the cities. There‚Äôs no coffee shops up here except Sbux so I thought I‚Äôd go back. The interview was great except for the fact that I was hired as a barista again. Maybe it‚Äôs just the frustration of being a green bean again while having so much experience, but I HATE it here. I‚Äôve tried being kind and tried getting to know my coworkers but it‚Äôs like a huge clique that I‚Äôm not apart of.

Has anyone else had an increase in custies making modifications at the window in the vein of ""I forgot"" or ""it's supposed to have this"" I know our prices are ridiculous and just keep rising but I'm tired of my times being bombed because people keeping changing to alt milks or adding foam at the window because they wanted to skip being charged. 
We repeat orders back drink per drink and have the displaying screen at my store but it's still happening so we've started making a point to charge for the mods at the window especially for repeat offenders, and clarifying on almost every order that a VSCCB doesn't have any foam. 
Which obviously they're getting pissy about but my baristas remaking multiple drinks a peak when they're doing ham on bar and doing everything theyre supposed to be doing and ending at a 44+ plus is discouraging. 
Also for clarification we don't do this in cafe we apologize, adjust, and if the situation feels appropriate we give them a quick explanation on how to order to get what they want consistently.",Window Modifications [Rant]

starbucks,"I was a partner from 2015 to 2020, just before the pandemic hit (217xxxx partner).

What killed me about this job was the forced customer connections. Me and the other partners are always being told by our store manager that we'll get fired if we don't improve our customer connections. I was always being told to sit down at customers tables and ask them what they're up to and how their drink is. My store manager would stand next to me, whispering in my ear ""tell her that her scarf looks nice"", ""they're on their phone, think of a way to get them to talk to you""). It was so draining.

My relationships with the regulars over the years started going downhill when they started to realize how forced the conversations were (me, panicking on bar during peak with sweat falling down my face: ""HI HOW WAS YOUR DAY TODAY?!"", them: ""good how are you"", me: GOOD HOW ARE YOU"", them: ""you asked that already..."", woops).

Over the years, I constantly felt depressed, and anxious. I always took work home. I was stuck in the barista position with no opportunity of moving up because my customer connections were bad. I would say 90% of the baristas and supervisors I've worked with were all dealing with severe anxiety too.

I now work at a movie theatre as a manager. The people at this job ACTUALLY believes in me, and that's the best feeling ever. Best of all, no forced customer connections, just a simple ""welcome! hope you enjoyed your show!"". I feel a lot more respected by the higher ups and the customers. No more going home overthinking ""damn that interaction with that customer earlier was so awkward, they're probably thinking about it"". No more scrubbing floors or toilets either.

starbucks,"TLDR: I was fired after management neglected my proper training and I made too many mistakes after reaching out for help several times and being let down.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is allowed. I see a lot of baristas on TikTok talk about their negative experiences being employed with Starbucks and I wanted to share mine. This might be sorta long so thanks in advance if you choose to read.

I came to Starbucks as a barista with several years of supervisory experience at another high-volume food chain. I trained at a different store than the one I was hired at and was noticed as a fast learner by management and other partners alike, with some even making ""undercover boss"" jokes because I didn't seem like a trainee. After about three months and with some encouragement from several shift supervisors at my store and the one I trained at, I applied to be a shift supervisor at my training store. I interviewed and got picked the same day, which meant more hours and a major pay raise for me, which I was in desperate need of because I had recently left a toxic relationship and I was financially devastated. I was SO excited about this opportunity, it was everything I ever wanted!

The beginnings at my new store were rough. My first day went as planned with mostly computer-based training the whole day. The next day, another shift supervisor tested positive for COVID-19 and went into isolation, along with several other partners and I believe another shift supervisor too. I was told I would be a regular barista for the week and my training would resume the following week, which was no big deal. 

The following week, I thought my training would continue as planned. I thought I would finish the computer training, shadow a supervisor for the week, and then be on my own. On the first day of continuing my training, I came in for a mid-shift and was told I was actually running the floor. And so training was over. I had mentioned this to the ASM and SM later on as I was concerned I wouldn't know everything and mess something up but they insisted I got my full training and I was fine.

I thought I did mostly well. A lot of other partners were really annoyed with my presence as they wanted my role (and deserved it more since they were far more seasoned). It was so intimidating because I felt like all eyes were on me and any question I asked about this store's particular setup (I couldn't remember from when I first trained there) and SS-related questions felt like I was being discredited and it was proof I wasn't qualified for my role. After a while, however, I think I grew on most of them and I even made some friends. 

I was dedicated to my job. I loved it. I felt I went the extra mile quite often there. I covered others when I could, went in early/stayed late almost every time I could, and never had a problem switching with other shifts. I never gave any of my partners trouble about calling out/leaving early/whatever and always made it work even though I was only ever given JUST enough partners to make the store run with no ""wiggle room"" (if I lost one partner for the night it guaranteed complete chaos).  I never turned away a barista that needed a ride home.  Being mainly a closing shift, I was the only authority in the building from 2 pm to close, and I had to deal with a lot of dangerous situations (unpredictable homeless people, drugs being done in the bathroom, etc.) But I always faced it. 

Things got sort of rocky about 2 months into this role.  One of the shifts that also worked close showed me that when she comes in, she takes one till from each register and two from one of the front registers as you usually don't need it for the rest of the night, so I started doing that. On one shift where the ASM worked with me for a few hours, he found out and scolded me. He had put that till back in and I had completely forgotten as I was so used to taking it out, so it stayed in the register overnight. Not too long later, I had closed and left the cash pouch in the back, on the desk. That was my verbal warning. I was told I would receive a written warning next time, and if I made another mistake after that I would be terminated. 

I was starting to stress. Things in my personal life were also not great and my mental health was taking a nosedive. There were multiple occasions where I tried to get my shift covered because I just felt like I couldn't do it but management told me there were no shifts who could cover it as everyone was already at 40 hours. Every time I worked I was terrified my next mistake was around the corner. I had asked management multiple times if I could switch to mids or mornings. I explained that I felt that nights were for more seasoned shifts as they work it alone with no other shift or manager to peer review. My store's opens usually had the SM, ASM, and two shifts. Our mid usually had one shift that overlapped with open and close but they had no open/close duties obviously. It just didn't feel fair that on top of not being properly trained, I had all this responsibility, and nobody was ever there to check that I wasn't missing anything. They told me there was just no way for me to not work closes. I tried to do my best with what I had and take a more positive outlook on things. I got myself a to-do list of the most important things to check, I was seeing a therapist through Starbucks, and I felt like I was doing better.

It was clean play night. I had agreed to work every clean play in exchange for working two mids a week and being off on Thursdays and Fridays (which I never received). In the weeks prior I had been asking the ASM if the morning shifts had any feedback for me on my clean plays as nobody ever left comments in the book. I never got trained on what to clean save for one night I did it alongside the SM, but we had a callout so he said we were going to half-ass it just this once. There weren't guides on Store Resources for every single thing listed on the clean play checklist. I was eager to know how to do EVERYTHING in the store so I was constantly looking to improve. one of these days when I asked, the ASM wanted to know what I didn't know so I asked him to show me how I'm supposed to clean the cold brew system and he basically just showed me to wipe down the top parts. This day, though, he told me he had feedback from the morning shifts and he listed a bunch of things not getting done, including the cold brew. He then gave me just a verbal walkthrough of the super complicated ACTUAL way you're supposed to clean it which was not what I was told by him before. He gave me a resource printout and was sure to leave at his scheduled time as always. 

The night was super stressful, I tried to take apart and clean it myself but even though I did it as instructed it wasn't working. He tried to walk me through it over text but ultimately told me I had to leave it because it was clogged from not being cleaned correctly for weeks on end, which he definitely blamed me for. By the time he told me to give up and leave it for the morning, it was 11 and I still had to count drawers. By the time I was done, my partners had long been finished with their tasks and were waiting on me. As I was going to put the drawers in the safe, the bottom one slipped and they all spilled on the floor. In tears, I had to pick up the coins and recount everything. I told my partners to just go home. I know I wasn't supposed to be there alone but they had been waiting so long already. I finished around 12:30 I think and finally went home.

The next day, I was feeling much better. I had just finished the process of applying for the ASU program, and I was feeling very thrilled about the opportunity to finish the biology degree that I've been trying to get for 4 years. Immediately after I called and scheduled a meeting with an SM next to my boyfriend's house because I was moving and this store was looking for a morning shift. I was so thrilled.

But when I came in, I got fired. I had left the deposit bag on top of the pastry case ""overnight"" (opening shift comes in at 3:30 so for three hours) and therefore I needed to be automatically terminated, but I was welcome to apply anywhere as a barista after thirty days.

That was 5 months ago. I have applied to so many Starbucks here so many times, I have called and talked to the SM's about my specific situation, asking to just be a barista, but they never moved forward with me. I have probably applied to at least 300 jobs since then and haven't landed a single one. I'm constantly on job boards looking for the next ad. I can't even doordash because my car is broken down and I can't afford to fix it so now I'm limited to remote jobs or jobs within walking distance. Debt collectors are constantly calling me. I've had not a single dime for five months. I tried to apply for unemployment twice but Starbucks fought it and won. I'm still grieving everything I lost; my job, my chance to go back to school, my path to financial stability. and I hate myself so so much for that negligent stupid mistake and now I'll never get redemption, and I still feel like I was let down by management who promised to support me in my journey but rarely lifted a finger for me when I needed it. I know I should be over it by now, but, you know... what I could have been. Something so much different.",Terminated From Starbucks- My Story

starbucks,"This is such insane logic it *kills me.* How in the fuck can you rationalize this.

If I do not have *equipment to make drinks*, I have nothing to put on the handoff. Without equipment, I cannot make as many drinks at once.

So the lobby becomes congested. More people waiting, for longer time periods. With our third espresso machine I could make 2 drinks at once‚Äîor shaken espressos in half the time.

But no, it‚Äôs better to have more handoff space. So they took our 3rd machine away. Wtf? I should be handing them drinks quickly as they‚Äôre made quickly. If there‚Äôs abnormally large orders I can set those aside.

As a customer Im generally satisfied with the way you handle orders, most of the time its seamless and once I submit my mobile order I pick it up trough drive tru in 10 min or less, never had an issue and I‚Äôve been ordering this way for more than a year.

Fast forward to the past two months and for one reason or another I‚Äôve opted to pick up the mobile order at the store instead of using drive tru, this has ‚Äúopened my eyes‚Äù to the level of hauling ass you guys are doing just to keep up with everything at once, which got me thinking that this will eventually burn out employees since its non stop for a good chunk of their day.

Do you feel that this is the top reason some stores have started to unionize?

Do you feel that the in store customer experience has gone down hill?

Is the mobile order function the main factor contributing to burn out?

starbucks,"Just a question from a new partner who was recently borrowed by another store. I was on bar and someone ordered a Hazelnut Frappuccino, so I made what the sticker said which was just a Coffee Frappuccino with Hazelnut Pumps. I handed it to the DTW and he gave it back to me and said Coffee Frappuccinos that have syrups added automatically come with whipped cream, and the sticker didnt have to say add whip, it's just the recipe for Coffee Frapps with syrups. Usually Id ask if the customer wanted whipped cream if they ordered a 'Hazelnut Frappuccino,' and Id ring it in as Coffee Frappuccino, Hazelnut Syrup, Add Whip because I figured whipped cream wasnt implied.

I couldn‚Äôt find any record of any remake that entire week and she didn‚Äôt know who she had spoken to and didn‚Äôt have a receipt in the app or physical, no cups, nothing. Our store has a policy where we won‚Äôt replace drinks that were made more than three days ago unless they call to let us know they won‚Äôt be able to come in until then. Come to find out she got it last Friday (the day she said she got it changed twice, but this was the final answer) so I checked that week and sure enough it still wasn‚Äôt anywhere there. To appease her, (because she said how dare I do this to her in front of her kids, who weren‚Äôt paying attention in the back seat) I remade a different frap and split it into three cups, while she called me an ‚Äúidiot with absolutely no sense‚Äú and other names and demanded my name, which I gave to her. 
This all coming the day after a lady threatened (and then feinted throwing something at me while laughing) to throw a hot drink in my face (and laughed that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to call the police because she would be long gone, she works in an ER as a nurse btw) because I was trying to resolve her issue because she was mad a barista had told her please not to honk to get our attention (still in a polite voice) and got out of her car to demand an apology and she was going to call corporate, and she wanted her name, and I wouldn‚Äôt give it to her and gave her my name instead because I was worried for that partner‚Äôs safety. Idk man I‚Äôm so tired of customers thinking they can treat baristas (or any person in customer service) like they own them and can do whatever they want to them and like we aren‚Äôt real people with feeling just trying to do our jobs. 
Pro tip: if you are a customer reading this, we will go out of our way to help the people who are nice to us. If you are mean, you‚Äôre probably the 50th person who treated us like trash and we‚Äôre going to do the bare minimum. Please, I don‚Äôt want to hear all the ‚Äúwell just find another job if you hate it‚Äù comments. Like, what? Why don‚Äôt you find a better attitude? We‚Äôre paid to make a drink, not to be a verbal (sometimes physical) punching bag. Who raised these people, and why didn‚Äôt they learn empathy? It‚Äôs not that hard to be nice, a lot of people take it every day. I understand being upset if your drink is wrong and your day was bad and this is the final straw, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs just coffee to you, even if we remember the cruel words said to us, long after. Moral of the story just be nice

starbucks,"i've been growing as a green bean and im proud of my growth. ive been put on bar most of my shifts but today i was put on brewing station/reg. the last time i was on this position was quite a while ago so i didn't really have a clue what to do. my ssv told me to prep the blonde pour over then proceeded to hand me an entire blonde veranda bag since we ran out of the cube. i assumed that they wanted me to grind the entire bag so i did, but when they found out, they got frustrated and grilled me for it. then they took me off reg to solely focus on brewing station (and i didnt know what to do since i havent done it in a long time. all my usual shifts start AFTER the brewing station tasks are done too). i felt really stupid and like a kid.

i guess my question for this is: what am i supposed to do on brewing station? i know im supposed to watch the coffee but what else?

i am also a closer with this same ssv. dont get me wrong, they are a good person and they have well intentions, but they really have a way of treating me like im still a very new person. i am still learning but they treat me as a kid. it wasnt until my gm intervened where they finally left me alone on bar and left me alone to watch the floor. i think they low key hate me for that intervention which sucks. there will be times where i am working with another partner who has been here longer. id be doing the floors while ssv is in the back doing ssv things, so the partner is solo-ing when its dead and they'd be going back and forth for restocks, make more lemonade, get more inclusions etc and the ssv is fine with it. but when im solo-ing while its dead, the ssv grills me for ""leaving the floor empty"" (despite me taking around 10 seconds to go to the back then to the front). it's worse because the ssv will always tell me to start prepping inclucions, mocha, whipped creams and more while im solo-ing but none of the clean containers are on the floor which means i have to go to the back to get them, but i cant because im solo-ing. so me solo-ing is not productive with this rule.

On Friday, I was getting ready to go into work at 2pm when I got a call from our SM. She asked if I wanted to work the next morning at 5am-10:30am. I told I've never worked mornings but I was willing to try it. After that I learned from social media that several people from morning shift tested positive for COVID. I connected the dots. That was the reason they needed coverage. I thought it was a bit weird or even inconsiderate not to mention that there was COVID exposure during the shift I was being asked to cover. But I guess confidentiality is a thing too? Anyway, I did the shift and just masked up. When I showed up, everyone was wearing masks too. I guess they heard about it too. Idk I know the US kinda failed in its response to COVID and the official guidelines now are like ""ehh.. do whatever"". Everyone's become more relaxed with not wearing masks, etc. But I still feel like it's important to inform workers of a possible exposure, am I wrong? How does your store handle outbreaks? I didn't work during peak COVID so I don't know. I think too it's a job where you're interacting with hundreds of customers a day that may or may not have COVID.

starbucks,"I've been working for nearly two months as a barista. I get a lot of positive feedback from other shift managers, I get kind corrections from them, I feel safe asking questions to them or just being open with them about my thought process and clarifying the root of where I messed up if I make a mistake. At this point, they all seem to trust that I know what I'm doing in a lot of areas, that I'll ask questions when I'm unsure, and they ask me if I know how to do certain things just in case they need to clarify anything before assigning me a task or so they can ask someone else if we're busy and someone else is more prepared/knowledgeable etc. I'm constantly doing work, never just standing idly and if I am it's for 7 seconds thinking about what I should be doing   


But this one shift manager................. They tell me to do things I'm expected to do regularly, even if I've already done them. And in a way that I feel like I'm being talked AT, not to. They come look over my shoulder and criticize what I'm doing, even if it has nothing to do with any specific processes I was trained on or even if I'm literally actively doing something a certain way that they or other managers have told me to do in the past. An example of the former is that I got critiqued for having sugar packet trash right next to the cup... as I was putting in the last 2 packs of sugar.... and was already planning to throw away all the trash immediately after finishing putting in the sugar. An example of the latter was that I was pulling a bunch of warming tickets (today was busy all day so there were constantly many tickets) after running several items to hand off, and I was trying to see what all bakery I'd need to grab and if there were any doubles of anything so I could warm them at the same time. In the middle of my thinking, I got critiqued for pulling the tickets and was told I should already have things cooking in my machines. This is true. But I swear they've also been a person before to tell me I NEED to pull tickets otherwise I'm gonna fall behind by not cooking things 2 at a time when I can. This is an example of how I feel like I'm always doing SOMETHING wrong, even if I KNOW I'm doing what I've been told to do in these super specific situations. 

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway. I'm one of the only partners, even the newer ones, that I've noticed they are so stern towards with the way they interact.   


I feel suffocated and uncomfortable when I work with them. I feel like I am constantly doing something wrong or not enough, it makes it hard to keep a good attitude. Them being so critical makes me feel like my efforts (I am a very hard worker!) are not recognized. I am starting to dread working with them. Because really the vibes are like a negative cloud hanging over my head even if everything else about the shift is going well (happy interactions with customers, getting tips all throughout the shift, good vibes with my other partners, and just being aware of my own work that doesn't get recognition)",One of my shift managers continuously makes me feel like I'm always doing something wrong or not good enough

starbucks,"Matcha has been added to many menus worldwide. Just recently came to Santiago Chile. Anyway I read online that Starbucks adds sugar to the matcha powder and also the drinks are made with sweeteners. Im not surprised this seems typical for Starbucks for 30g sugar drink. my only concern is how is Starbucks able to manufacture so much matcha? It seems like besides the sugar, the matcha feels very dense. Matcha is hard to produce and japan would be seriously straining if they had to produce high amounts of matcha for Starbucks. I know China has a large matcha industry and is known for selling lower quality off brand which is Cheaper. I would assume the matcha in starbucks is from china or taiwan etc but the quality is not that bad which is what urks me. Is the matcha actually from Japan?

starbucks,"** I want to start of by saying I am a previous partner. Been gone a year and a half. 
I know it‚Äôs a tough job on most days and customers can be horrible , I strive to be simple and kind to baristas knowing what I‚Äôve experienced during my time at Starbucks.

Today I went in for my first pumpkin cream cold brew. ‚Ä¶. Yes I know I am that person. 

I normally order it as a tall in a grande with foam to the top. 
I know it‚Äôs annoying. I get it. Mostly because our mind always first wants to get the tall and you have to switch it. But we also know we will just end up wasting the foam anyways. 

The barista at the store told me I had to order the grande if I wanted the extra foam. 
I said okay that‚Äôs new but okay charge me for the bigger size but please don‚Äôt do more cold brew. Too much cold brew and I get extra jittery. 

I shouldn‚Äôt let it bother me but I don‚Äôt understand if this was a her problem or Starbucks thing? I looked on the app and the way I ordered it would not have charged extra for the foam to the top.

starbucks,"So  I got hired by starbucks about 60 days ago on the dot. I didn't finish my week of training until a few days ago, and I was finally a free bird away from my trainer. My trainer was honestly not the best. She was sort of very condescending, I had to ask permission before doing almost anything, she was sort of rude all together, and just kind of a shifty trainer for me. She would tell me to be faster, but stand at the bar and wait for the person to arrive and pick up their drink every time. Unfortunately I cannot do both. 

The day after I finished my training, another partner (a ss) called and asked me to cover for them from 7:15 to 10:30).. I agreed because I figured a shift super would know if it's okay for me to be covering this early off my training. I come in and my shift is just a wreck. I was on window for about 2 hours but once they switched me to bar (my first time ever) it was so bad. The printer would not stop and there was only one person helping me. I had 30 cups with stickers lined up and ready to go and customers were getting upset. And then....someone orders 2 venti lattes with 6 packets of agave each. So here I am squeezing 13 packets of agave into these damn cups and it hits me. I cannot do this job. 

So I texted my manager the next day saying this Jon is not for me and I will not be coming back. I said it a lot nicer than that though. Should I feel bad for not giving my 2 weeks? I figured it was completely unnecessary seeing as I hadn't even finished my week of ""practice shifts"" and was absolutely not an asset to the team in any way.

starbucks,,Greetings from Finnish Starbucks üá´üáÆ
starbucks,"I‚Äôm a shift and I have a barista partner that I work with FREQUENTLY (maybe 3/4 of my shifts are with them). We have the closing shift, so it‚Äôs typically just me and them. They‚Äôve been one of the main closing baristas basically since they transferred to our store. And they‚Äôve been at our store for probably 5 months now. They were a partner at another store for a few months before that. 

So, at this point, they should really have a grasp on how to do just about everything. We even have a written out closing list. But for some reason‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like I have to tell them HOW to close during EVERY close. If they aren‚Äôt sure what to do, they‚Äôll just‚Ä¶ kind of pretend??? To wipe the counters???? It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm SEEING wiping happening, but I guess it‚Äôs just too gentle?? Almost like they‚Äôre wiping the counters to look busy instead of doing it to clean them.

The part that I need advice about isn‚Äôt even really that. It‚Äôs the fact that this barista‚Ä¶ works so slowly. All. The. Time. We have several green beans now and they‚Äôre all essentially lapping this barista. We‚Äôll have customers waiting for a single drink for 5 minutes. And this partner won‚Äôt even use that time to connect with the customers. Sometimes I‚Äôll work with a barista that doesn‚Äôt really connect, but it‚Äôs because they make the drinks so fast that the customer doesn‚Äôt even notice. But with this barista‚Ä¶ the customers just sit there for FAR too long‚Ä¶ waiting for their drink. It‚Äôs not even just making drinks that takes too long. It‚Äôs every task.

So, I guess my question is: how do I tell this partner to PICK UP THE DAMN PACE? It does get frustrating for myself and other partners having to feel like we all have to do our own jobs, as well as half of this partner‚Äôs job. But I‚Äôm just not sure how to say, ‚Äúgo faster.‚Äù",Tall rant / need some advice

starbucks,"I walked in today, threw my keys in the safe and quit.

I started at a drive thru Starbucks that was busiest in the district and loved it. I was living in my car attempting to survive and I appreciate the company for that.

Moved to a city and went to a Starbucks that did 15k+ a day and can only be described as a place where baristas go to lose hope for 6 months before transferring to a cafe. All 7 of the transfers that came while I was there all quit by their third shift.

My distain for the company slowly increasing over the last two years, watching my baristas getting screamed at and my bosses saying there‚Äôs nothing we can do. Watching all the illegal anti union activity that Starbucks was doing.  My boss promising more hours and eventually going from 30-40 a week to 9 with him saying there‚Äôs nothing he can do but he‚Äôs sure it will pick up next quarter( after I go through the majority of my savings of him promising more hours this quarter and scrambling to make rent for three months)

I finally hit a point a week ago where I was reprimanded for being too talkative on register by my boss(outside hire).

starbucks,"I quit Starbucks yesterday and my mental health immediately improved. This is the tea I was scared to spill and share because I did not want to jeopardize my job. Now, I don‚Äôt care. Y‚Äôall need to know the truth.

While there was coworkers who I truly enjoyed working with, there were some I truly did not. I will just leave that at that. That‚Äôs with any place, right? But when the problem people aren‚Äôt corrected, that‚Äôs an issue. Anyways‚Ä¶

I loved learning about coffee and honing the craft, but quickly it became apparent that Starbucks no longer cares about that. They just want to continue making billions off of their dedicated followers and their sugar infused coffee addiction.

While working there, I dealt with some of the worst working conditions I have ever been faced with.

Firstly, the fruit fly problem. If you want my advice as a former employee, ask for no fruit pieces in your refreshers. Don‚Äôt get anything with vanilla bean powder, chocolate malt powder, java/frappuccino chips, and matcha. These are all stored in semi-open containers that do not close fully. Therefore, fruit flies chill in and on the containers. I had to work the day before we got the pest control treatment for our store and a fruit fly flew up my nose. They were landing all over me. Landing in drinks, landing on food. Some baristas didn‚Äôt even throw the drink away they would still hand it out. A fruit fly was found in the cold brew keg before we closed it up and my shift scooped it out and put the lid on to use it still. So, additionally I wouldn‚Äôt drink the cold brew. I wanted to quit there and then.

Secondly, the store I worked at needed a remodel so so badly. It had ceiling tiles missing, our AC would break all the time, and the drain would constantly back up. When I, the ONLY one who spoke up at the store meetings with our district manager, asked about a remodel she said ‚ÄúOther stores would be grateful for what you have.‚Äù We were told we were on the list but low on the list for a remodel. Two store meetings later the district manager announces two new stores. So they can build new stores that no one asked for but can‚Äôt improve the already existing stores? Awesome! 

Our ovens literally set the pastries on fire. Cookies would light on fire. Sandwiches won‚Äôt cook all the way through. They‚Äôre still waiting on new ovens. We finally got new espresso machines the beginning of this year. How does a billion dollar company not have the funds to outfit every store with quality equipment?

Thirdly, (and this has nothing to do with the company‚Ä¶ although, they encourage this ‚Äúcustomization‚Äù culture) the customers are 80% entitled assholes.  
Even when I worked at Olive Garden, McDonald‚Äôs, Cheddars, etc. I never encountered some of these kinds of people. I got cursed out for being out of Sugar Free Vanilla. I got yelled at through the speaker box because I was out of caramel drizzle. I got complained about because this man was yelling at me about how he wanted his latte made &amp; I corrected him for being an asshole (respectfully, with much effort). A man once asked me for exactly 16 ice cubes. I was making someone else‚Äôs drink with the standard scoop of ice and he threw a fit thinking it was his drink. I looked at him dead in the eye and said ‚ÄúThis is not your drink.‚Äù His face turned red from embarrassment and he sat his ass down. People complained about their mobile orders never being ready when the truth is, everyone and their momma is sending their order in between 6 am and 10 am so you are gonna have a wait regardless, Karen. Don‚Äôt yell at me cause your 4 venti (large) overly sugared and complicated lattes aren‚Äôt ready. In truth we needed a third espresso machine, but we‚Äôre lucky to have what we did, remember? üì∑

Fourth, the management. During the time I was there (11 months) there was two Store Managers. The manager that hired me left two months later. We were without a store manager until about february/march. The man that was a hired (a truly kind man) was an outside hire who was entirely new to Starbucks. He lasted 3 or 4 months I think, no offense to him. He did his best trying to make our store better and they ran him off.  He left at the beginning of July. We were without a set store manager for the month of August and instead of us getting a new one they pinned our store onto another store manager! She doesn‚Äôt answer texts, you can only call her. When you did call her you got voicemailed. And if you or what you had to say wasn‚Äôt considered important? Good luck getting a response! 

I asked to have a meeting with District Manager to discuss all of these issues above, and yet was met with contempt because I was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to reach out to the temporary Store Manager who had her own store to run and doesn‚Äôt answer calls.

if i order a grande sweet cream cold brew, it arrives with liquid up to the top and filled with ice. this suggest that there's less liquid than if i were to order it without ice. if i order it without ice, it arrives with liquid up to the same level.

my question is this - what is the extra liquid? is it more cream? is it more coffee? is it just a little more of both? my target is to get more cold brew, but not sure which is more strictly controlled - the coffee or the cream?",a question to baristas regarding cold brews w/o ice

starbucks,"I stopped by NY Starbucks location to grab a cup of coffee although there were other cafes nearby cuz I knew this one had a restroom I could use. While there was a wait in line, I asked one of the employees for the WASHROOM passcode and I would like to inform you of the terrible experience you could get from this store. 

When I politely asked for the passcode, she/he replied there is no such thing as a restroom in this store. 

So I pointed to the place where all the people were using it, and then he/she replied "" oh there was one? I did NOT know that"" with a very sarcastic tone. 

I asked him/her again politely (ex. could you ask your co-worker) since that denial attitude was appearing to be intentional, and he/she was clearly rejecting to respond to my question. She/he even said the restroom passcode is posted on the wall. (Meaning she knew we were talking about THE WASHROOM. So of course, I replied, there is not. Then he said, ""then I don't know lol lol ?""

The employee's attitude was distinctly rude and intentionally denied to tell to the specific person. I found this extremely disrespectful and I truly felt that was racial discrimination. 

I understand that everyone has a tough day, but this situation like asking for a passcode would not possibly make any employee upset. 

After that, I shared this conversation with the employee who‚Äôs in charge of the store at the moment,
As soon as I approached to her, she suddenly ran into me and finally informed me the toilet code and apologized that she thought I was asking for WIFI password since WIFi and WASHROOM sound the same. Looool. 


 In where does Starbucks have Wifi password? 


The one in charge told me that he/she had had a tough day today so I gotta understand? This interprets to me as that whenever she/he has a hard day, she/he seems to take it out on other customers who look seemingly easy-going and have different racial appearances. 

I would like to inform you this and truly wish this does not happen to other customers in the future and beware! Dont ever ever ask for washroom in US because they suddenly forget the passcode for the toilet!",Don‚Äôt ever ask for WASHROOM at Starbucks!

I just couldn't help but notice that two of the policies contradict each other: drive-thru times and getting to know the customer.

starbucks,"**tl;dr at end**

I'm here to rant because this particularly involves my current (and new - since mid early August) job at Starbucks. So, to first provide my context, I stopped working at a restaurant job (that I was fairly new in late April-early June this year) to pursue my professional certificate in cybersecurity. I had stopped working for about 2 months because I passed this certification after 2 months of hardcore studying (woo!). I decided to quit the restaurant job that I was working at because I never really liked the workplace anyways and it wasn't my cup of tea when it comes to working in the service industry. Management also sucked too.

Fast forward, I'm now hired at Starbucks and currently working as a new employee when school starts. Since I had switched my majors, it's taking a bit longer for me to finish my degree so I decided that it was in my best interest to do an extra load of classes. These **online** classes were already accelerated enough but instead of the standard full load of 5 classes, I did 6. (these classes are a quarter long, btw. 8 weeks each and there's the first 8 weeks of the semester \[first session\] then the 2nd 8 weeks of the semester \[2nd session\] so the classes are divided by 2). I had already planned this out before I got my job at Starbucks and now that school has started, I'm starting to realize the consequences of having a physically tiring job with an overload of school work. Though I only have 3 classes, all of them are expecting of all students to do continuous studying and engagement, combined with labs, projects, and tests.

Throughout this whole ordeal I also found out that I needed to pay for my own tuition for this upcoming winter semester and I'm about $5000 short so I'm trying to earn as much as I can so my parents don't have to pay as much and we can split the money. So me working is definitely a necessity.

I guess the best way to sum up my problem is that my (somewhat) physically and mentally (sometimes) taxing job at starbucks is not mixing well with the extra load of class that I'm taking. It's already hard enough to find time to go to the gym and enjoy my own time but it seems like I'm either working, studying, eating (while working and studying), or sleeping. While I know that the most common solution right now would be to lower my hours, I don't think that lowering hours would help my case since I still need to earn enough to where I can afford to pay for most of my tuition next semester.

I've been thinking about a job that's remote and something along the lines of customer service. Which not only makes it easier for me to manage my time with classes but also just to get out of the food/beverage industry. I've been working in the this industry since 2019 and needless to say, I'm quite exhausted from all the physical hard work and mental stress when it comes to dealing with hangry customers.

**tl;dr** \- i'm stuck at a wall. I hate to leave my new coworkers because everyone is so nice and I hate the idea of job hopping but I'm also realizing that the physical and mental demand of starbucks is not mixing well with the stress of my classes but i'm forced to work due to tuition so i really dont know what to do",(RANT) School is clashing with job

All that being said, I'm kinda thrown for a loop when I'm working bar and someone orders with a personal cup. What's the standard procedure for making drinks in a reusable cup? Iced teas/refreshers are pretty easy because they're built in the shaker then poured into another cup. What about iced lattes, iced caramel macchiatos, Frappucinos, etc where you have to use the lines on a cup? We have a regular that comes in with a Yeti personal cup and orders a venti iced decaf Americano with SF vanilla, half and half and extra ice. I just kinda eyeball everything, but she says she likes it. I notice my order is a little different everytime I order with a reusable cup. Just wondering what you guys do.

starbucks,"I‚Äôve been a Starbucks regular for years now. Obviously, I‚Äôve seen plenty of changes. Two of them linger as unanswered questions, and I‚Äôm curious if maybe I‚Äôm nuts or perhaps others see these things too.

1) Several years ago the cups or lids changed, and lids became much less secure. Coffee drips out no matter what - yes, the seam is opposite the lid opening. I‚Äôve had some baristas and managers agree that something obviously changed, but they were never able to explain. Our collective hunch is that corporate changed suppliers. 
2) Store volume. Music has been turned up to a much higher volume in the last year or so, and on top of that, the staff seems to be in a competition for who can make the most noise. Slamming things around, dropping things then laughing wildly, yelling at each other despite having headsets, and shoving that ice door so hard it could possibly launch into the parking lot. I‚Äôm in upstate South Carolina but have noticed this in plenty of stores nationwide. It used to be a semi-quiet place to get stuff done while enjoying friendly baristas and good music. It‚Äôs bordering on a loud dive bar at this point.

Now, while I‚Äôm at it - the baristas in the Greenville metro area supplied me with time, space, and coffee to write my dissertation and I am forever grateful to them. They got a line in my final manuscript. They are wonderful people.",Two questions burning inside me

starbucks,"Kinda long but please read anyway!

I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all noticed the BS Starbucks is putting us lesser paid employees through so please read my situation and any advice or help would be great.

I‚Äôve been working for Starbucks for almost 5 years. I‚Äôve always tolerated it for the pay and my lovely coworkers. (There‚Äôs not much high paying jobs where I‚Äôm from in Texas, but trust me.. starting last week, I‚Äôve applied to almost 25 different jobs)

Around 8/17 my ASM, SM, and DM had a sit down conversation with me at the beginning of my shift to discuss others partners concerns of my mental health and well-being. I agreed that I have not been doing okay, but it‚Äôs not any of my managers business especially if I still do my job correctly. They showed me a log of my clock-ins and outs and tried to tell me they can write me up for me being ONE MINUTE LATE two days in a row. They also tried to tell me another SSV remembers me pulling a no call, no show which is completely false. I remember specifically calling in sick that day‚Ä¶ which I have every right to do. Now, me being late by 60 seconds is because of the Covid check ins we have to do. 60 seconds. I understand policies are policies but are you kidding me?

Anyway, I was essentially faced with either taking a 4 week LOA and that I can file for disability through Sedgwick to get paid for my leave. OR I can take the write up and continue with work and just take the day off. Knowing I am grounds for demotion after this second write up (if I accepted and signed it/didn‚Äôt take the medical LOA) I feel like this is completely messed up. But it‚Äôs okay because they‚Äôre offering/reassuring me that I will still get paid‚Ä¶ so I thought.

I had immediately contacted Sedgwick for a case and all that to see what was needed to get me paid with the LOA hours I earned. Sedgwick is now not paying me anything for disability considering that they need my psychiatrist‚Äôs say so on documented paper for 4 weeks off of work.

This wasn‚Äôt my psychiatrist‚Äôs idea, it was my managers. I can‚Äôt ask my psychiatrist for something he didn‚Äôt even do.

2 weeks later, I am now completely broke, lost my brand new apartment that I can‚Äôt even afford to break lease at. I‚Äôm back at my moms where I‚Äôm not necessarily welcome. I feel completely screwed over by Starbucks. I feel like I‚Äôm purposely being thrown out of work for something that I didn‚Äôt deserve. 

I already tried the CUP fund for a place to live but my manager had denied it. I tried calling Sedgwick but I‚Äôve gotten hung up on TWICE by accident I‚Äôm assuming and now I‚Äôm trying my best with PCC. 

If anyone can help me do something about this, I would love the input.

Thank you.",SSV faced with LOA or a wrongful write up. Issues with getting disability pay. Can anyone help me?

starbucks,"so for some background, i work at a pretty high volume drive thru/cafe store, i‚Äôve been a barista for about 4 months or so now and the day i was hired was also my SM‚Äôs first day, so naturally it‚Äôs been a bit of a transition for the whole store. not to mention with school starting we just lost half of our staff, we just outside hired a bunch of shifts that are having to learn barista AND shift duties and everyone is worn completely thin. ALSO! there‚Äôs always something broken or that we‚Äôre out of and the time it takes to get it fixed only for it to break again or run out again within hours is insane!!! i‚Äôm absolutely sure this is not a problem specific to my store but moving on

as we all know, pumpkin spice season started 2 days ago. so naturally, we‚Äôve been pretty damn busy. we still have the old mastrenas at my store, so we pull blonde from the drive bar hopper and decaf from the cafe bar one. the entire drive thru mastrena broke the day before pumpkin madness started, so we can‚Äôt pull any blonde shots and we‚Äôre down to one machine for cafe/drive/mobile. cool, we can manage, just have to be careful what order we‚Äôre pulling tickets and making drinks since there‚Äôs only one machine that can pull shots. today, decaf went down which is really great considering it is the only thing besides like herbal tea and milk that doesn‚Äôt have caffeine in it :,) oh yeah and our nitro machine works probably 2 days out of the month, to the point our SM has started consistently telling people in drive thru who try to order it ‚Äúit‚Äôs like the mcdonald‚Äôs ice cream machine, it‚Äôs never up and running haha lol‚Äù

we have no blonde espresso, no decaf espresso, no nitro, the poor baristas who end up on hot bar are dripping sweat and nearly in tears trying to keep times down and make drinks right on the ONE working machine and cold bar is running around trying to do all they can to support hot bar and keep up with their drinks too, all while we have people legitimately shrieking about pumpkin spice over the headset in drive thru. the ticket was put in for the blonde bar multiple days ago now, and lord knows how long it‚Äôs gonna take for them to come fix it. i‚Äôm just waiting to hear that our other mastrena bit the dust and we have no espresso bar whatsoever lmao. 

i just feel like the team we have is so strong, the majority of our tools and supplies are just either broken or missing completely, and we aren‚Äôt ever able to actually be set up for success due to the lack of actual tools we need to be successful to the standards they want from us

this was longer and significantly harder to follow than i meant for it to be, but that is also how every single shift i‚Äôve worked for the past week has been so it‚Äôs fitting

ps someone confirm for me that the chicken and bacon panini was discontinued bc my SM yelled at me today bc i told someone that in drive thru but the button is gone and i also actually read it somewhere probably the weekly update???? i feel insane who can relate

starbucks,"One day I decided to go to this one branch instead of Barnes and Nobles to study because I was bored. 


The first 3 minutes I sat on the table studying, this one barista said ""Hey you"" and I'm like ""me?"" She asked if I wanted this free frappe and we had a brief convo about it. I found that little interaction cute so after studying I'm like ""maybe I'll get another free frappe again if I come back"" jk I just like talking to people. 


So I went back again the next day, she asked how the frappe was, another brief convo. But that was it. I kept going everyday (I'm a 2 week regular now) she always hi to me and asks how I'm doing everyday then she started serving the drinks (the tables are kinda far off from the counter) to me that I got mixed signals if she was flirting or just being really nice.


So I asked my other barista friend if this girl was flirting and she said yes. So that made me make scenarios in my head on how would I make my move to try to get close to her that I ended up being shy when I get to the Cafe and seeing her that I acted cold and didnt even greet her. Then I realized I had a big crush on this barista.

After that, she was off for a couple of days and then when I finally saw her again, I did the same thing and acted cold. For the whole time I was there studying I wanted to talk to her but she was working and I'm shy like an anime school girl, 


I finally snapped and made a scuffed letter from scratch  
I spent the entirety of my stay working on it but in the end it was still so bad but I saw her with her bag about to leave that I had to rush my letter and I basically asked her out in it, when I saw her leave I ran to her, couldn't find my words I just said ""hey"" covering my face with my arm because I was blushing too much. Gave it to her and I ran away. 


After that I have not seen her for the past 3 days so I'm thinking maybe she quit because that interaction was the cringes thing she's seen all week. Am. I just overthinking or she hates me üò≠ 


tl;dr. Barista was really nice to me that she became my crush. 1 or 2 weeks later, I gave her a letter saying ""ur really interesting, let's go out"". I have not seen her for 3 or 4 days ever since that

So I need opinions

on monday, i was separated. i‚Äôve had issues with my sm for a while, and 2 doctors appointments too close together and a call in the day after one of them (i had to get a treatment for a chronic illness) made my sm (honestly understandably) believe i was lying to get out of work and it was a last straw for both of us and i left on as good of terms as a separation could be. my sm and asm are still being very supportive of me. my starbucks experience got me some easy opportunities and i got a new job that pays nearly 5 dollars more per hour than i was making at the bux, and with guaranteed hours, i found a new, better apartment with the sweetest roommate in the world, and am so much less tired, physically and mentally. all in three days. thanks to separation pay, i don‚Äôt have to worry about the dreaded inbetween jobs time, and i‚Äôm still in contact with most of my old coworkers.

starbucks,"Dear Baristas,

I am a long-long-longtime customer of Starbucks.  I pick up coffee every morning on my way to work.  At this point, I haven‚Äôt missed a day in over two years.  Sometimes I use the drive thru, but mostly I place my order on the app and run inside to pick it up. 

What I am met with, each and every day from the baristas is a smile and a warm hello.  Yes, I‚Äôm a regular, so they all know me at this point.  But I see them do it to everyone.  Whether or not you‚Äôre asked by management to do this is beside the point.  It‚Äôs genuine, and I can tell.  

To all baristas:  Thank you.  I‚Äôm convinced you don‚Äôt hear that enough. 

Morning is an interesting time of day.  When you see your customers, their day has either gotten off to a good start, or a bad one.  Too often you‚Äôre on the front lines of someone fighting a bad day.  They make you the face of their problems and lash out, nearly always, for no reason.  I‚Äôve seen it happen. 

I can‚Äôt think of a place that requires multitasking more than Starbucks.  I watch you.  I‚Äôm in awe of you, honestly.  You are taking endless orders, all customized, while handling cash transactions and listening to gripes from customers.  And the Karens.  There are so many Karens. 

The teamwork you display on a minute-to-minute basis is inspiring.  As a hiring manager of my own firm, seeing Starbucks Barista on a resume will always get my attention.  You are such a talented and hardworking group.  You may argue that there are exceptions, and surely, anytime you employ as many as you do, there will be exceptions.  But they are so few and far between.  They are not who I‚Äôm talking to.  I‚Äôm talking to YOU.  Thank YOU. 

Your coffee literally makes my day better.  Even when there‚Äôs not enough cream.  Or too much cream.  Or it‚Äôs not hot enough.  Whatever.  It‚Äôs coffee.  The world will not begin or end with my coffee.

But I know my day will begin with a smile from my barista.  And for that, I am grateful.",An open letter to baristas

this has blindsided many partners. this works out to be about ONE semester covered, IF even that. if you are someone who is unable to get grants and scholarships because of your parents income then you are screwed. if you are considering working at starbucks to go to ASU you need to be really careful about how your tuition is being covered.

starbucks,"Man. I still think about my job at Starbucks and how much of a nightmare it all was. Basically, I had just graduated from college with a bachelor's of science degree. I applied for several jobs in my field, but was often shot down for not having enough experience. So I decided to just apply to Starbucks thinking it might hold me over until I find something more legitimate. I ended up getting hired. 

But man. There I was, getting paid next to nothing, getting bossed around all day by high school students, being stuck with the filthiest jobs nobody else wanted to do. I was educated with a legit science degree, probably more educated than most people there if not everyone, but everybody treated me like I was just the stuuuuupidest idiot in the whole store. They gave me barely any training at all, and then would get pissed at me or treat me like I was just an idiot if I had a question or didn't know how to do something. Anything that ever went wrong, even things that I had absolutely nothing to do with, I would get blamed for. Someone put a cafe order on the mobile order stand? I must have done it. Drive thru line moving too slowly? It couldn't be the BARISTAS in charge of making the drinks....it had to be the *stupid idiot* handing them out. I swear when working DTR or DTO, I was constantly berated over the drive thru times, even though it was obviously the baristas who were taking too long to make the drinks. Just because I happen to be working DTO, doesn't mean I have control over the drive thru times. 

I was also micromanaged to hell. Any slight thing I did differently, was the wrong way to do it. If I ran a customer's card before handing them the drink, I was berated for it. My manager would constantly be standing over my shoulder, talking to me like I was a 4 year old child explaining how to run the credit card and hand them the drink. No customer ever ONCE complained about me running their payment before handing their drink. They didn't even notice, it didn't even delay them whatsoever beyond like a second or two. If anything, they would get confused by me handing them the drink as they were handing me the card, like this awkward fumble. And then the one time I do it my manager's way, the customer's payment gets declined after I hand them the drink. Of course she wasn't around to see it, so I probably got blamed for that too. I also remember one time when it got slow and nothing was going on, so I went into the back room to take a drink of water for like 30 seconds. At which point, I was literally berated for taking a tiny break and drinking water. 

Nobody ever trusted me to work on bar. I would often get *trained* to work on bar, but then the next day I'd just be stuck on DTO or cleaning the bathrooms or some shit and never worked on bar again. I would have loved to make the drinks, like whenever I did it it was actually fun for me, and I felt like I was doing something important for once. But I was considered too stupid to ever do it. For the 6 months I worked there, I probably worked on bar for a total of 2 minutes. 

Eventually I just got so fed up. I remember one time someone who I went to high school with came in, driving a nice BMW and wearing nice clothes, clearly successful. And there I was with my little stupid green apron and hat. So embarrassing lol. I just couldn't handle thinking about what bullshit was in store for me the next day. I started showing up late, but I'd still do my job the best I could. Ended up putting in my two weeks notice, but my manager fired me literally the day before my last day, just one last ""fuck you"".  

Sometimes customers could be assholes, for sure, but the people I worked with were even worse. At least an asshole customer doesn't stick around standing over your shoulder the whole day. I recently went back to my old Starbucks and found out that hardly any of my coworkers even work there anymore. Not even my manager.",Starbucks was easily the worst job I ever had.

Flash forward to today, I am working as a Business Analyst/Project Manager for my Local Government's IT department. I love my career and enjoy what I do but I have been craving working at a Starbucks again, honestly since I left. I genuinely miss being a Barista so much.

I've inquired about open positions at some of the local stores within 5 miles of were I live (There are 4 stores) and the Store managers have told me that Starbucks has never offered seasonal positions for employees and that Starbucks recently implemented a minimum amount of required hours worked by partners of 12 hours per week, and a minimum of 17 hours of posted availability. I was very disappointed to learn this. I could very easily give probably 20 hours of availability, but since I am in my career, I don't know that I could guarentee 12 hours EVERY week. I was hoping to be an option as needed in peek seasons, like Now through the Holidays, or even in the Summer months in the afternoons.

Now, my Store manager is back the week I work 30hrs,  so make this make sense because my hours are being slashed in half. When I asked why my hours were getting cut, She literally cannot give me an answer that makes sense. She says something about ""labor budget""this, and ""We got 60 extra hours but-"" that... We've lost one shift manager, COVID is traveling around our store and one worker is dealing with troubles in their personal life. So where the F are the hours going?!?!!!!!!! This makes no sense and I am so frustrated with no one to express my frustrations to because my store manager clearly isn't hearing me or making me feel supported by CUTTING MY  HOURS. She won't even tell me if it's going to get better in the coming weeks. She literally just says it depends on the ""business"" and then she just shrugs and acts like it's goddamn nothing because clearly she could care less. I don't work as a borrowed partner because I was sent home crying from another store and refuse to put myself in that situation again.

Now, my Store manager is back the week I work 30hrs,  so make this shit make sense beach my hours are being slashed in half. When I asked why my hours were getting cut, She literally cannot give me an answer that makes fucking sense. She says something about ""labor budget""this, and ""We got 60 extra hours but-"" that... We've lost one shift manager, COVID is traveling around our store and one worker is dealing with troubles in their personal life. So where the fuck are the hours going?!?!!!!!!! This makes no fucking sense and I am so frustrated with no one to express my frustrations to because my store manager clearly isn't hearing me or making me feel supported by CUTTING MY FUCKING HOURS. She won't even tell me if it's going to get better in the coming weeks. She literally just says it depends on the fucking ""business"" and then she just shrugs and acts like it's goddamn nothing because clearly she could care less.

for instance: iced London Fog Tea Lattes are made by steeping 2 bags of Earl Grey in a short cup of water, then building in the shaker like an iced tea or refresher (tea concentrate to the base line, milk to the milk l√≠ne, vanilla, ice, shake, pour)

Customer: make it with whatever it usually comes with
Me: it can come with either one 
Customer: lemonade then 

Just a tip to customers. Whenever you order ALWAYS order with the size FIRST and if it‚Äôs hot or iced. 
Good Example: I would like a Venti Iced Caramel macchiato
Bad Example: I would like a caramel macchiato 

You can even say small, medium, or large, we know what you mean. DO NOT say ‚Äúregular size‚Äù.

Baristas aren‚Äôt technically allowed to offer straws for drinks that do not require one as our cups are literally meant to be used without a straw.

starbucks,"Tomorrow is my last day and all of these are purely based off of my 2 years here. 

1. Absorb as much as you can from your training and never be afraid to ask for help.

2. Try out other brands of espresso, starbucks isn't that good tbh.

3. Its not a bad thing if you're not always on bar. Others need a turn and you might just aide your team better somewhere else.

4. We are a team. Not everyone gets along but try to support your team as much as you can. It makes for an easier shift. 

5. Be kind to your openers, odds are they have the highest traffic hours. This is a coffee shop.

6. Your closers want to know what you need to open. They don't need to know every little thing that was wrong.

7. If you're opening, fully prep and stock everything you can think of. It can turn your whole shift around.

8. Do NOT live and die for this job. It can be fun but its a job. Your joints and bones are not worth the wear and tear. 

9. If you're a high schooler be respectful of your full time partners. This job is their livelihood and not always a fun place for you to chitchat and play around in. 

10. Stores that gossip all the time are not worth the hassle.

11. Grow a thick skin. The things customers say and do to us can be vile and rude. I promise holding on to any of it will hurt more than you need. 

12. Find your regulars, these customers will be the best you have ever known and are more than worth the trouble of others. 

13. Unionize. Your managers are more often than not, not a good source of information about unions and cooperate does not care about us 

14. Do not be afraid to speak up against your shifts to your manager if something wrong is happening. Your concerns deserve to be heard

15. Enjoy it. Starbucks is a rush like no other.

starbucks,"In the middle of peak I'm dumbfounded by a reaction a customer of mine had. She ordered a venti caramel frappuccino with 6 SHOTS. I pulled the shots directly into the cup, pumped 4 frap roast, and there was barely room for 1/4"" of whole milk. She saw me struggle with the whip and scrape it off once because the drink came over the top and I wasn't able to put the lid on (our whips were like frozen today and acting crazy) and there was a bit left in the blender but not much more than typical with some venti fraps. The excess got dumped as per usual. 

Well she didn't like that, but first started out by asking ""Is there 6 shots in this?""

""Yes""

""And that's 6 more shots than like what the 2 or so already in it""

""No, typically this drink doesn't have any espresso, this was 6 total shots and 4 pumps frap roast""

""Oh, well you did you throw away the rest usually there's more left""

""...Yes""

starbucks,"i was taking orders like normal when this guy pulls up to the speaker box, misses it and then reverses back through the drive through. he starts getting pissy at me when i tell him we have no caramel drizzle for a caramel frappichino. so he orders his long ass drink then starts to speed of before he throws it in reverse and comes back to the speaker box. he proceeds to go ""actually a tall"" so i asked him ""you wanted that in a tall instead of a venti? "" and he yells"" no! the same drink but in a tall!"" so making sure i wasn't getting anything wrong i ask ""you want two? one in a venti one in a tall?"" he screams yes and drives off too the window.

Admittedly it was only two partners on the floor and we ran out of vsc for his vscc so  after i make the vsc i go to the window and tell him his total. he just looks at me with his phone and says nothing. i ask him ""apple pay? "" and he says yes so i hand the card reader out the window and he asks me ""do i insert my phone before or after?"" and confused say "" insert your phone? for what""  he responds like a smart ass "" for the points!

at that point i close the window in his face and turned around to ask someone else to handle it.

However, I am going to be taking a gap year and stay at home in a different city. I tried transferring the normal way, but I was told since I am going from a unionized to a non unionized store the transfer process looked different.

Up until a month ago, I was scheduled regularly at the store in my home city. We had a change of store managers, and I was no longer on the schedule at all. Only just today was I told that the store is not going to take me back onto the schedule, which is not fun.

starbucks,"Dear Starbucks and Howie - you are slowly KILLING all things that Starbucks was and all things they stood for.  Do you know how many baristas cry on a daily basis at work?  Probably not, they have to hide in the bathrooms/backrooms to make sure your ""THIRD PLACE"" is always intact.  Do you know how many of your ""partners"" have anxiety attacks on a daily basis about work, having to come to work, or how they will afford to live?  Probably not - most of them hide/mask this for fear of losing their jobs.  Starbucks used to be a place that EMPOWERED their managers to go above and beyond for their partners - and now you have turned them into micro-managing robots ( of course there will always be exceptions) that have little to no outlets to spread JOY to their partners.  

This is the reason I left - this is the reason you are losing great partners, this is the reason your partners want to unionize.  THEY DO NOT FEEL LIKE PARNTERS.

You have stripped their will to pour their hearts unto their jobs, you have run them ragged by not providing enough coverage hours to do their jobs in a way that would make them and customers happy.

Unfortunately you have made this only about money and power.  Its truly sad.  I wish I could hug all the partners that put their heart into their work and never see a return.

starbucks,"The good ol' shaken espresso with no ice bullshit. We have a new regular who has been ordering this drink. Venti Shaken Espresso, No ice, No Classic, with Almond Milk. Naturally when I arrived at this drink while bar supporting I told the baristas to let me know when this person showed up so I could explain that this drink isn't meant to be made this way. The baristas informed me that this regular is deaf and they have a hard time communicating with them so all of them have just been making a Venti Iced Quad Latte with no ice, essentially. 

Today I got the mobile order again so I wrote on the cup ""This needs to be ordered as a latte, thanks."" I genuinely am not trying to be rude, I just want them to get what they want and understand that a shaken espresso is not what they are actually ordering. I'm not sure what will happen next or if they even noticed the note however I'm not going to give someone special treatment just because they are deaf/hard of hearing. Actually I find it quite rude when someone acts entitled because of a disability. I try extremely hard to treat everyone the same, equally, no matter who they are or how I feel about them (if I know them well). Everyone deserves to be treated fairly. I feel as though it is not fair to give this one person a pass just because they aren't willing to try and communicate with us.

That being said, I'm not sure if anyone has ever actually explained to them that this drink cannot be shaken and *IS,* in fact, an iced latte. I guess we'll see. I have not checked the price difference on a venti shaken espresso vs a venti iced quad latte. I don't know what the correct way to go about this is, I'm just hoping maybe next time I can actually talk with her somehow to help clarify what these drinks are so that she can order exactly what she wants.

What would you do in this situation? Am I wrong for writing a note on her drink? Was I rude and/or inconsiderate? I truly don't mean to be however I've been second guessing my decision to write on her cup and I think I could have worded a little better. I'm open to suggestions and constructive criticism.

starbucks,"I applied for a shift manager for a long time ago 2 out of 5 partners have gotten the interview but have not gotten promoted yet. Ever since I applied I started to get attacked by my manager Carley Houser out of nowhere as if she was trying to find ways to fire me. My 1st warning is understandable I take full responsibility but the 2nd to the separation letter is not sitting well with me. I was told that on august 9 I would get an interview but then my manager was nowhere to be found which is understandable I‚Äôll wait till Monday the 8th when I get my 2nd write-up out of the Blue Moon but it was small lateness not big numbers and it was my final notice for the last two weeks I felt uncomfortable working there. Recently on August 1st during that time we had a shift that quit so we had no closing shift and have been closing the store early cause there was no outside shift that didn't wanna help or close on their day off. On August 22 I came in expecting there to be a closing shift it was enough time to find coverage. I thought wrong I came in at 2 pm hearing that the store was closing in 3 hours I was there in shock so my mind was to do support and do the close at the same time while hearing the morning shift she wants to leave she doesn't deserve this we have to leave 5 on the dot while I was stressing About the trash if my partners are okay Then we kept getting false information that a shift from Bayonne was coming never came by the way. The store was closed at 5 and left at 5:30 then I heard mumbling from the morning shift wny and edge water I didn't put my mind to it cause I clocked out I was scheduled 2-8 wanted to go home.Then my manager started to text me if I went to edge water an hour later I scratch my head I told her I left and was on the highway that was an hour away From Starbucks and tells me to turn around and come back. The following day she asked me what happened I told her she said well I don‚Äôt know what Kevin the district manager thinks about this situation and said clock in and see if your numbers work which shocked me which felt like a threat. Two days pass by I was worried and then the day came I get the letter it didn't affect me on the spot but these past two days have been taunting me every partner thinks that the separation was wrong it bothers me a lot because there are partners that came at the manager call out constantly who always come late but never get talked with or written up and the night crew is thinking she's coming at the night care only.

I then looked up the iced chai latter and it's even more sugar at 61g for the venti. I get the chai frap 3-4x/wk fyi

Can someone explain how that works? someone else kindly answered in another post that sugar is pre-added to the chai mix which explains a lot. Is there another syrup added or is the ""chai mix"" just chai and sugar?

starbucks,"I work mornings at 4am and constantly I'm placed in the drive-through, doing both DTO and DTR. I liked it in the beginning, but the morning shifts put me there all the time and it's burnt me out too many times--no one at my store likes the drive-through and it's only green beans who are placed there. 

I was placed on DTO/DTR today and noticed that the times were unusually high--I checked and saw that I was waiting on a few food items for the car at the window. Everyone was occupied and I asked a few times on headset if the food was ready, but I didn't get a response. So I left my area at the drive-thru and walked to warming, which one of my coworkers who is a shift supervisor (but wasn't the ""keyholder"" at the time, if that makes sense) immediately yelled at me in front of my other coworkers, saying ""Can't you just wait at your position. Do you know you're not supposed to leave? You're really stressing me out"", and immediately I apologized because it wasn't my intention. 

I don't know but I feel humiliated in some way. Previously there were multiple times where her coaching seemed a bit pretentious. She'd start her comments with ""Can you please \[...\]"" or ""You're supposed to know this/that"". I accepted it in the beginning because I was a new barista, but I just can't do this anymore :/ I also don't really know if this is because of Starbucks policy or something, but none of the shifts at my store ever work at the drive-thru, they're either on front or customer support. 

I'm always placed at the drive-thru. I'm really starting to despise it, I've asked if I can be switched, and my morning shifts say that it's my only option--that I can do DTR/DTO, or both.

one of my friends just started working there with their partner, and they just dyed their hair pink and were told it's not allowed for sbux employees and they had to dye it a natural colour. their partner also told me that they weren't allowed to wear any kind of makeup except eyeliner, no lipstick or anything.

is this a new thing, or is this just the bullseye management giving them false info? because they weren't told by the manager for the sbux, they were told by a manager of bullseye.

i feel like saying ""no lipstick"" is really a tad too far for limits on presentation. nail polish? sure. it chips. hair colour? weird, because i don't think anyone's sweating hard enough for the dye to drip into food. lipstick? how is that a food safety hazard?? even if they're all masked (which isn't required for them anymore but they still mask up) they still can't wear it. it baffles me.",question for people who work at starbucks

starbucks,"Hi yall I was curious if there's such a thing as a Shift Trainer. Like barista trainer but for shift supervisors. I was trained for my position by my store manager and we haven't hired a brand new shift since I've been there. We've just had people transfer in who had some prior experience as a shift. So I was just wondering if only store managers can train baristas to become shifts, or if it's possible for a shift supervisor to train people to become shift supervisors? I ask because we just had this new shift transfer in and he only had a little experience as a shift, but did all his training already, but my manager had me run a bunch of shifts with him to train him. But it was just me like free wheeling it based on how I know to do the job. It wasn't like I was using modules or anything. And like I said he had done the training so he knew like how cash management and stuff worked, but I was more explaining like when to do what things and like the flow of the store.  


Anyways, I really loved training him and I realized I miss training newbies. I've trained like 7 green beans and I almost always love the experience I have with them. 2 of my trainees have become Shift Supervisors and pretty quickly too. And I'm super proud of both of them. One of them was a gifted almighty natural and took to everything so quick. The other struggled and I coached her and continued to coach her and she got better and better and better. And she always told me what a great teacher I was. She is such a ray of light and I know some of her past and getting that promotion I know meant a lot to her. Also, I have to say I love being on more of my own schedule when I'm training. It feels nice to have more control of your time at work.  
Anyways now that I'm a shift I know its super rare to have me train new hires. And honestly, the experience I had training a shift this week was really great. I would love to train more people becoming shift supervisors. Like I'm thinking the same way the barista trainer system works where we follow along a training plan and the modules and shit. But all I know of is my own experience where my store manager trained me.",Are there shift trainers or is that just a store manager thing?
starbucks,"today we were understaffed because someone called out sick, so our close was already going to be a bit more difficult then usually but no big deal. turns out that shit is a big deal, our opening staff have been rude and pushy with how we‚Äôve been closing (it‚Äôs been taking us 45 minutes to close the store since we are so low stock on everything and such a busy store so we make a mess) saying that we forgot to clean the vanilla syrup pump and bs like that. was working a 4.45 hour today, close ran extra long since we were short someone so my shift gave me the option of either going home and leaving him alone in the store or working through my lunch. either one was very much not ideal but i know he would never put me in this position on purpose, he truly felt bad about it. i didn‚Äôt want to leave him completely alone so i said sure and worked through my unpaid lunch. 90 minutes. it took us 90 minutes to close and it was a bad close at that. manager needs to not schedule closers for 4.45 hour shifts cause if it takes an extra 15 minutes it fucks over everyone!!! anyways just wanted to rant because this was so frustrating 0/10 would recommend but at least my shift is super nice and tried to make it a good experience :)",why do these things always happen to me.

starbucks,"i need u guys to tell me what to doo! ok so
i interviewed for starbucks and during my interview i was asked if i would be willing to be at other stores in the same city. i said yes because there was no particular reason for me to only work at that specific store. so turns out they were sending me to train at a store as a new one was opening up. at the store i was training at, i made such good friendships with the partners there in a matter of a few days. they‚Äôre all very good at working together and very good with each other aside from work as well. sadly i had to leave them as soon as the new store opened and i hoped it was for the best. unfortunately, they turned out to no be very nice people. they‚Äôre not very good at communicating for work and teamworking. they spend the time they have in between peaks talking instead of stocking things, cleaning up, chechick ice, etc. (which they could honestly do while talking since they‚Äôre using headsets anyways) but honestly i think this mostly bothers me because they usually leave me out and when i do try to talk and start conversations i‚Äôm shut out. i‚Äôve never had a bad interaction with them or anything, but they‚Äôve just known each other before and maybe that‚Äôs why. that‚Äôs why transferring back came up, but idk what to tell my manager cuz i cant just tell her they don‚Äôt include me lol (and if i do they‚Äôd prolly deny it either way) but yeah idk what to tell her. in addition to all that I've inly been at the new store for a few weeks. would i need to be there for a certain amount of time before transferring or no. also, the store i wanna transfer to is further from the one im at now, so i cant use commute as an excuse. plz lmk your guys opinions on what i should do. im honestly so confusedüò≠",vent rant :))

starbucks,"Former partner here. I was employed in 2016, promoted in late 2018 until I was separated as a SSV in 2020 without probable cause (HR is no help), returned in 2021 as a barista thinking I could start all over and quit the same year because I realized this life is behind me now. I put off my education because I was so invested in moving up the latter. I only hung out with coworkers and I constantly thought and spoke about Starbucks in social settings. My friends that didn‚Äôt work for the company found it very annoying.

One year later, I am a different person. I have a 4.0 gpa in college, employed at a local coffee shop making more tips and better hours, and more importantly, my relationship with my close friends that never worked for the BUX improved immensely. There are times where I do miss working for the company and the few good customers that made it a positive experience, but I remind myself of how horrible of a time it was while working there. 

My current job, we are required to sign an NDA to prevent any sort of workplace hostility such as gossiping about coworkers. I cannot tell you how fantastic it is that I work with people that do not form cliques, talk about each other, and support each other regardless of their skill set on the job. We know we signed a contract and we can get fired if we spoke badly about one another, but it subconsciously influenced us to see the good in each other instead of finding a trait that bothers us towards each other. Having a positive work environment without any animosity truly does improve your well-being and mentality overall.

To all the baristas out there, you are all doing a great job. I understand that most people who move up do not deserve to be in the positions they‚Äôre in, but try to overcome it and prevent engaging in any sort of negative interactions with other baristas, SSVs, SMs and even DMs. We all hate the cliques, gossiping, the unsupportive behavior, nepotism, favoritism and horrible customers, but remember YOU are wonderful as a person. Don‚Äôt let Starbucks consume you and make it your personality, it will hold you back and possibly fall into a depression like I did. Go in, do your job, and go home. North Star? Third place? Customer connection? Do the bare minimum. The company can care less about you and replace you in an instant, so as I said, don‚Äôt let it become you. If you need the job, then stay. If you want to move up, that is also good too, just remember who you are deep down inside. Life outside of Starbucks is great. I am a lot happier leaving behind the toxicity that was prevalent within the company. You don‚Äôt have to be like me and leave to be happy, but I‚Äôm just sharing my experience. If you have great partners, a store manager, and district manager, consider yourself lucky because I see that as a rare occurance, cherish it. Nevertheless, do what makes you happy regardless. 

Have a wonderful day and keep trying your best!",There is life outside of Starbucks.

starbucks,"I'm still fairly new. I've only worked part time for about a month now. I feel like I haven't been fully utilizing my markouts. I want to get as much as I can because I feel like I'm leaving money, or food, on the table. And that only goes back to benefit a big corporation. Anyway, I usually come in 15 min before my shift and get a free coffee. After working, I usually get a free sandwich and iced tea. So, that's two free drinks and one food markout. I know they say we get three free drinks per shift. Is that other free drink only accessible during my shift/on my break? Can I get my free coffee before my shift and then two free drinks when I leave? 

Okay, then food markouts. We get seven food markouts a week. I usually only work four days a week. I've worked three days this week and go in tomorrow, Sunday. Like I said I usually only get a sandwich or other food item everytime I work. That's three food markouts I've used this week. I should have four left. Does that mean tomorrow I can go home with four free food items? And how do I do that? I've bought more than one food item before and when I select ""Partner Food"", it only applies it to one item then charges me discount price for the other items. On the POS, do I have select each item in the order and apply Partner Food? Or do I have to do separate transactions for each item and apply Partner Food on each transaction? 

Last question (I know I've gone on long)... food markouts on days we're not working. My SM briefly explained it to me when I was hired but I didn't understand fully how it worked. I think she said we can only mark out food on days we work. If we plan to come in on our day off, we could mark out a food for that day. How does that work? For example, I know I will want a blueberry muffin on my day off. Do I just mark out a blueberry muffin then come in on my day off and tell the barista working I already marked out a muffin? Is there something else I'm missing? How do they know we marked it out? Do they check? I can see how that could possibly be abused.",Question on Food/Drink Markouts

On the register, when a customer wants to add a splash of milk, there are the buttons for light, regular, and extra (1/4"", 1/2"", and 3/4""). So, I charge him on the left side of the milk tab instead, because it is 2in, but he gets mad at the charge and starts screaming at me through the window telling me that 2in is less than 3/4"", and the shift who is trying to get this guy out has me not charge him for the milk.

starbucks,"I‚Äôm positive that this has already been talked about at some point but I really just need to vent right now. 

I was on register and a customer came up to me ‚ÄúDo you guys have the Marble Frappuccino?‚Äù I told them no; that it is not on our menu, but if she has a recipe that we can follow, I‚Äôll be happy to send it along to the barista on bar. She proceeded to pull out her phone and show me a TikTok. The video didn‚Äôt even have the written recipe, I just literally had to watch the guy make the drink. If I‚Äôm remembering correctly, it ended up being a Caramel Ribbon Crunch with cookie crumble, caramel drizzle, mocha drizzle, and whip cream on the top and bottom. I was so beyond annoyed that I had to stand there and watch the video, when the customer could have had the recipe ready to go to read out loud or hand to me to read.

She should have sat down, watched the video herself, and wrote down the order for us. 

I remained pleasant and she got her drink made exactly how she wanted it, but this was the first time I‚Äôve had to deal with this.

starbucks,"Can anyone give me an honest second opinion on how I‚Äôm doing, how bad my mistakes are, and what to do with this one supervisor who has a lot of issues with me? I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm in a lot of trouble, and I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. 

I‚Äôve been working at starbucks for about a month and 2 weeks, including training. I‚Äôm still struggling a lot. It‚Äôs a combination of things that are making me feel behind, but if I had to simplify it then I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a mix of subpar training and my natural tendency to be bad at details. 

I trained at a different store because there were a lot of new hires. A lot of the training was online. I was able to practice a bit of CS and P.O.S. and I only got about 2 days on bar. There were a lot of things I was only told or shown once very quickly with little to no practice that I had a hard time remembering. 

I was lucky enough to get retrained for 3 more days after a few weeks of a lot of mistakes, and I feel a lot better with the job. The only issue is that now everyone knows me as an anxious mess so I‚Äôm not well respected. Some people are nice but others don‚Äôt give me the benefit of the doubt anymore. I feel more secure in my knowledge of the job now because I had a chance to ask all my questions, and get told all the rules and terms I didn‚Äôt even know existed up until that point. But I‚Äôm still working on speed and accuracy. I generally am bad with nit picky details. So even when I know what to do I mess up a lot, particularly on POS. (eg. accidentally charging for milk when you shouldn‚Äôt, accidentally scanning RTDNE items twice)

So, one of my shifts is really fed up with me. She‚Äôs new to the store and is a very detail oriented person. Knows how to do her job fairly well since she‚Äôs been at it for so long but in my opinion has difficulty with in the moment improvisation, which I feel is equally important. I feel like much of the time things inevitably can go wrong or slower than expected but she typically struggles to adapt to it and gets visibly frustrated. In moments like this she struggles with multitasking and lacks the ability to give clear instructions while she‚Äôs doing other things. Most people don‚Äôt get in any trouble for it because they already know how to do their jobs even without her instruction and have a reputation for being good at what they do already. 

She‚Äôs definitely more by the book than my other shifts. She always picks up on the little details I miss and gets really upset with me. Sometimes she feels guilty and starts being nice out of nowhere, but ultimately always falls back on getting openly fed up with me for something or another. Even off the floor she thinks I‚Äôm incompetent and doesn‚Äôt trust that I have any common sense. She doubts most things that I say even while we‚Äôre having small talk. And hasn‚Äôt asked me for permission before keeping me late twice now. Whenever something is off I‚Äôm the first person she blames for it. I get that sometimes I get anxious and have trouble doing the job completely correctly but she doesn‚Äôt respect me as a person. She‚Äôs open to other people about how much I hold her back and I feel like if I can‚Äôt do my job perfectly in the next few days she‚Äôs going to try to get me fired. She openly can‚Äôt stand me and looks exasperated just being around me. She‚Äôs right to be upset, there are a lot of things she‚Äôs had to tell me to do multiple times that I blatantly can‚Äôt remember or get right. But I feel completely and utterly disrespected by her in general and I think she truly has a problem with me. 

That said, do shifts have a lot of authority over who gets let go or at least in a lot of trouble? 

If you asked my other coworkers or shifts then they probably wouldn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm very competent either. But when my other shifts notice me make mistakes they are way more forgiving or able to improvise with it as it happens even if they are frustrated for a second. 

So yeah I keep making small detail oriented mistakes. More examples would be queueing shots before milk.. fumbling with cash.. being slow on CS.. asking if they want sweetener for the wrong drinks‚Ä¶ not putting names on every order‚Ä¶ 

I understand that my mistakes slow down the rest of the floor and I feel truly remorseful for it. But I feel like no matter how much I try to write down and retain, my inability to be detail oriented always comes around. I can‚Äôt stop messing up. And if I don‚Äôt get better soon, this lady‚Äôs issue with me could get serious. I don‚Äôt know what to do.",Can this one supervisor who has a serious problem with me get me fired?
starbucks,"For reference, we do sell decaf iced coffee in my region.

Lady pulled up and orders a decaf ice coffee. So I explain that we do not sell decaf iced coffee, but we can do a decaf iced americano instead. This is how the conversation went:

Me: we can do the iced americano for you instead!

Her: is that espresso?

Me: Yup, it's made with decaf espresso and water, so it tastes just like a coffee.

Her: But it's espresso.

Me: yup!

Her: so it had caffeine 

Me: well it has a tiny bit of caffeine, but just like a regular decaf coffee has a little caffeine. But it IS decaf.

Her: but it's espresso. 

Me: yes. 

Her: and espresso has caffeine.

Me: No, it would be made with DECAF espresso. So it IS espresso. But it's DECAF espresso. So it will be decaf.

Her: ...

Me: did you want to do that?

Her: yeah.

Me: what size?

Her: tall

Me: and anything in that...? Sweetener? Any kind of milk?

Her: light heavy cream.

Me: anything else? ^no *total*

Then she gets to the window and the bar partner has by mistake made it hot. *Remade* then she said is tastes wrong. But won't clarify what tastes wrong about it. Then finally the DTR figures out that she's is mad that the heavy cream is mixed in. So we remake is and CAREFULLY all pass it to the DTR partner trying not to wiggle it at all so the HEAVY MILK doesn't FOLLOW THE LAWS OF GRAVITY and mix in. 

She was in our DT for just shy or 13 minutes this morning during our Saturday peak. Bro. What? I am a very composed partner, but damn. Lady had me questioning if I know how words worked anymore. I CLEARLY used the word ""decaf"" 800 times. The DTO screen CLEARLY listed a DECAF iced americano. What is happening!!!??? Excuse me while I bang my head into the counter to make it end. 

Bonus story: had someone idle as the dt window for 12 minutes this morning before we opened. Car behind him, also waiting for the window, instead of... A parking spot? or even the order box? was there, idling 9 minutes to open, and then one more car at the speaker box 2 minutes to open.

starbucks,"Today I got yelled at by the rudest customer ever. I don‚Äôt know why Starbucks rewards people with this behavior. My coworker took this lady‚Äôs order and she got a frap with 6 shots and a sandwich. My coworker told me that she wanted the frap split into to cups. I told her to tell her that our policy doesn‚Äôt allow us to do that. The most I can do is give her an empty cup so she can do it herself. My coworker was scared to tell her this and she asked me if I can do it. Mind you, this lady is already at the window and starring me down while I make her frap. She was eyeing me the whole time when I poured her frap into the cup and rinsed out the blender. As soon as I opened the window this lady raised her voice and asked me why I dumped the rest of the left over drink that was in the blender down the sink. That I could have used the left over to pour to the second cup. I apologized and said that it is company‚Äôs policy that I‚Äôm not allowed to split it into two cups, the most I can do is give her an empty cup. She yelled at me and said ‚Äúwell why didn‚Äôt you tell me that in the first place! I paid for six shots of espresso!‚Äù I told her I‚Äôm so sorry but some baristas do not know that policy. She kept yelling and wanted a refund. She snatched the receipt and the pen out of my hand to sign the receipt. I explained that it would take at least 3-5 business days for the money to go back into your card and she went ballistic. I mean a full tantrum. Full screaming, full flailing her harms and pounding on the steering wheel saying that she was left with $20 and she needs her money now. I literally told her ‚Äúma‚Äôam I understand but I don‚Äôt appreciate you yelling at me‚Äù. She kept interrupting me and kept yelling that she wanted her money back. I understand that she‚Äôs frustrated but I am no responsible on your actions of spending 17.01 at Starbucks and I am not physically withholding your money. If you are truly broke, you would not stop by at Starbucks. Her drink alone was around $12. She wanted me to give her cash and she kept asking for a manager. That‚Äôs when my store manager stepped in and gave her entire order for free. I didn‚Äôt get in trouble. I actually got praised for trying to handle the situation in a calm manner but damn. The after affect of that scream had me shaking. Really surprises me how a grown adult can have a tantrum over a cup of coffee.",Venti sized rant
starbucks,"At my store, we‚Äôre told shifts are not allowed to do the pulls because they need to be on the floor helping?

starbucks,"Despite being one of many types of diabetes inducing syrups available for mass consumption in your local Starbucks, by far the most violent and and hostile of all of these is the chai. The chai pump is a lightning fast, extraordinarily powerful pump that takes wicked joy in showering upon any barista who dares go near it or god forbid- pump some into a cup for your 8$ drink in highly adhesive liquid. Unfortunately, a casualty was reported on this morn before the full rising of the sun. I pulled a sticker from the printer, it‚Äôs shears deciding my fate. I placed it upon a venti cold cup, and I quivered in my boots as I read ‚ÄúVt Iced Chai Latte- 8 pumps chai‚Äù. I failed to swallow my fate come so soon, and shoved the cup under the dispenser to begin the perilous task of dealing with the rouge pump. I braced myself for the dreaded unwilling shower I was about to receive. I did not pull back my sorry head enough, and horrors! Horrors! Horrors! I felt a great sting in my eye, and a spray of chai- a violent jet of fury and sugar- spattered my face. Like a valiant soldier struck in battle, I carried on with my battles, dodging the fury and fire of my enemy the chai pump. My eye burned, and I felt my lashes clumping fast as he poured the milk and ice into the latte. I handed the drink off, my compensated kindness making my face vizard to my torments. My eye, now red with the perils of my work, was screaming for my attention. I retreat to the den of stock and the ocean of filth, to nurse my wounds. 


Basically I got chai in my eye and I‚Äôm okay :)",Highly aggressive chai pumps

I told you already.‚Äù My coworker and I looked at each other like ü§® and I said ‚Äúlet me go give him the scone myself.‚Äù I approached him and said ‚ÄúYou need to be respectful next time‚Äù (long story short) He was upset about my statement, he had me sit down and explain how he was disrespectful.

starbucks,"My drink order is very simple. I ask for a vanilla iced coffee ( no classic syrup) with cream. Sometimes, my drink is made perfect. I could taste the bitterness and the authenticity of the coffee beans with just a touch of vanilla notes. Sometimes, It tastes watered down and too sweet. Other times, it is very bitter with no hint of sweetness.

Anyway, I understand that it is a very fast-paced place so the quality of my drink won't be the same every time. However, it would be nice to have a bit more consistency. I really like the taste of Vietnamese iced coffee. I am addicted to that sweet milky coffee-forward flavor. I heard that the white chocolate mocha syrup mixed with espresso would be an accurate replication. I am not sure about the ratio. Btw, I can't do grande or venti. I always go for tall.

I‚Äôm trying to find options for caffeinated beverage that I can stand the taste of. My college campus has a Starbucks so I figure something there is my best shot. Here‚Äôs a run down of what I‚Äôve tried so far. 

1. I like the idea of tea but no matter what I try it‚Äôs always too watery and weak. When brewing at home I experimented and got to 1 tea bag per 2oz of water before giving. The only success I‚Äôve had is peach Snapple and that‚Äôs more like juice. 
2. I‚Äôve found I like Starbucks chai lattes if I add an extra pump of chai. I‚Äôm interested in trying other tea lattes but I don‚Äôt think Starbucks has those so that‚Äôs not really relevant. 
3. I can‚Äôt stand the bitterness of coffee. Last fall I tried the apple pie latte (think that‚Äôs what it was called) and was optimistic because I love apple stuff but the bitterness off the coffee was too much. I tried a frappe, cookie crumble I think, and I could still taste the coffee too much. Honestly tasting the coffee at all will probably be too much. 


With all of this in mind, do any of you have recommendations for caffeinated drinks at Starbucks I can try?

Also, how terrible are ‚Äúsecret menu‚Äù items on baristas? Especially interested in hearing from any student workers on here who worked at their college‚Äôs Starbucks. I know there‚Äôs not an actual secret menu so just adding a bunch of stuff. I found some based off the chai drinks that could make for some nice variety but I don‚Äôt want to if it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs a pain in the butt for the person making it.

Any advice would be really appreciated. I don‚Äôt want to keep buying drinks I can‚Äôt stand to finish but really want to find some way to consume caffeine.

I as you will see I started working at Starbucks 2 weeks ago. So far enjoying it.

I think Starbucks is unique in the sense that our menu is very large and extensive and making all the drinks to the desired specifications is sometimes challenging.

I want to build a simulation game in which you can make all the drinks from start to finish‚ÄîStarbucks drinks simulator /Studio.

The hot and the cold bar.¬†the steps the works 

I think the existence of such a game will reduce the training time, and resources spent training and will be a quality of life improvement for baristas trying to learn! It will make us learn quickly so we can go through all the recipes and learn more quickly. New recipes can also be added quickly if training can be done quickly.

¬†If you guys know anyone in corporate who could give me some resources to make this, that would be awesome !!¬†  
I know I am a very low-level person working in the company but I feel like I can help make this training process fun and intuitive. I Did this in a day imagine if I get the proper resources to build this complete game how much easy training will be and how fun it will be !!!  

This is just something that I thought of It's okay if you guys don't want to do it LOL this I did just for fun!

If you can guys know anyone in the software team that would be really awesome!¬†

starbucks,"I see a lot of posts about ‚Äúservice dogs‚Äù and ESAs and general pets in Starbucks. 

PETS AND ESAS ARE NOT ALLOWED. 
SERVICE DOGS ARE. 

We are allowed to ask two questions; whether the dog is a service dog and what tasks they are trained for aiding in a disability. You CANNOT ask about the disability (visible or not) and you CANNOT require the dog to wear a vest or be visibly identified as a service dog, ask them to perform a task, require the handler to present paperwork confirming the dog is a service animal OR about their disability (the list goes on and you can read more on the website I linked)

Generally, many service dogs will be wearing vests or be visibly identifiable as a service dog. But again, NOT REQUIRED. They are also not required to be on a leash ONLY IF the tasks they are trained for require the dog to be off leash (ex. getting help if the handler faints or has a medical spell, retrieving items, etc etc). 

Please do not get yourself or your store into legal trouble for not following the law. You CAN legally ask those who are not in control of their dogs to leave, especially if they decide to treat a cafe floor as a restroom. Be assertive but try not to escalate the situation.

As recent as last summer I could get a challenge of ""purchase something 5 days in a row for 120 stars"", or ""buy 3 lattes this week for 100 stars"". But lately they have really been stingy with stars. My challenge last week was ""purchase something 6 days in a row for 50 stars"". That's ridiculous.

My wife, however, just recently got into using the app this summer after I convinced her that even if she doesn't go as often as I do she should still have an account for free stuff.

Last week she had ""purchase 4 days in a row for 80 stars"", this week she got ""purchase 3 days in a row for 50 stars"" while I got ""purchase 3 days in a row for 30 stars"".

starbucks,"Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm a former partner in the process of getting rehired. The store I interviewed at and got hired for is in-between store managers right now, so there‚Äôs a ‚Äúfloating‚Äù manager there and a store manager from another location nearby helping this store out (that‚Äôs who interviewed/hired me). 

I‚Äôm confused because I just got the official job offer email today, but it lists the other store location of the manager who interviewed me rather than the location I thought I‚Äôll be working at (the one where I was interviewed at and the manager referred to this location throughout my interview, which is why I thought that‚Äôs the store I‚Äôll be at).

Is it possible the offer letter lists the other location because the manager who‚Äôs hiring me is from that location but is hiring for this other location (the one I planned on being at), so she will transfer my account over to this location in the system? Or does this mean I‚Äôm hired for her location rather than the one I was interviewed at? Has anyone here ever been hired by a manager for another location?

The dog was approaching other customers, not listening to it's owners commands and putting it's mouth over the serving counter of drinks. I approached the store manager and informed her there was an offleash dog in the lobby of the coffee shop, the manager ignored me and continued with her work. I spoke to her again saying that by law, company policy and common decency all dogs need to be on leash. The manager refused to take action and instead allowed the owner and dog to remain on the premises. She then gave the owner a cup of whip cream for the dog. I then approached the dog owner and instructed her she needs put her dog on a leash because it is the law. The manager immediately approached me and instructed me I need to leave the store and will not be allowed to return. I did not receive my order and was not allowed to retrieve it. The manager then followed me outside and informed me I am permanently banned from that location for speaking to another customer. She informed me the dog was a service animal, which is a lie because service animals are not allowed off leash in public and must have appropriately marked harnesses. When I explained this to the manager she admitted she was aware the dog was not a service animal. She then said dogs are allowed offleash in their stores. What the heck can i do?

starbucks,"You can always ask the barista or look in the app to see the drink recipe. Many drinks have classic syrup in them. You can substitute this with stevia packets, which is what I do.

You can ask the barista to make it with stevia or you can add the stevia yourself later. I recommend adding it yourself until you know how much you like. 

You can also try the drink without sweetener. Some of the Frappuccino‚Äôs, like the matcha creme frap, don‚Äôt need any sweetener in my opinion. 

I am not a dietician, but this is what I do to limit the added sugar in my drinks! 

I also usually get nonfat milk instead of whole milk for some drinks, and that makes the drink less calories overall. For Frappuccino‚Äôs though, they come out too icy with nonfat milk, in my opinion, so I do 2% for Frappuccino‚Äôs. 

No shame in however you like your drinks but if you do want to reduce sugar or calories, this is what I do, and I still really enjoy my drinks!","Regarding the levels of sugar in many popular drinks‚Ä¶if anyone is trying to consume less added sugar in their drinks, here are some quick tips.

Annoyingly, I tell them again what I did(asked the partner to message the group, asked partner on shift) they then tell me the partner should not have texted/called them and that I should have called around to other stores before coming to them. I proceed to tell them that we are slammed, I only have one other partner on the floor, and a backlog of task I need to do and I didn‚Äôt have time to look up other store numbers and ask if they have any partners that could close for us. They then proceeds to say that I make 20$ a hour and I need to own it(this is the comment I‚Äôm concerned about) that they have coverage for me, and asked me to assure them that I will better utilize the ACT model. Annoyed and not willing to fight it since I have a full lobby and need to get back out on the floor, agree and we both hang up. 
Later on the partner who called out calls again and asks what was going on since apparently our sm didn‚Äôt bother to respond or call them back. 

All while having this conversation they had a very clearly annoyed tone to their voice. 

My question is, is this something that I should bring to hr or my dm? 
I‚Äôve been with the company almost 4 years now and I‚Äôve never had any issues with any sm with situations like this up until now.
To me it sounded like they were saying that I need to earn my wage which to me comes off as them using our recent pay raise against me which feels unethical.",Possible unethical comment from SM not sure if I should talk to my DM or HR about it.

starbucks,"so over the course of my 2 years the ASM has always found a reason to pull me to the back to lecture me and each time has resulted in me ugly crying because when I say I'm doing my best they say my best isn't cutting it. It's usually about 1) not being able to go faster on bar during a rush hour 2) not being able to multi-task DTO and DTW and count the change and take someone's order at the same time, or 3) today where I'm not being positive enough?? because customers assume I'm being rude since I'm monotone and have trouble maintaining a high fluid voice?

They always single me out for these things, take me to the back, and think reading Starbucks pamphlets to me about our ""mission/values"" will some how make my brain neurotypical or something. like, how is asking a customer, when vanilla is out, ""we're out of vanilla right now, do you want to try caramel instead, or something similar?"" rude??? just because I don't have a woman's voice and can't go high and fluctuate means I'm not being positive? it's such bullshit. and then I also had to spill I have autism and that reading people and normal socializing is incredibly hard for me. Now they're going to think I'm stupid or something and need to be babied. 

I've talked to my other co-workers and they say my ASM doesn't treat anyone else like this. Like if someone breaks a food item they usually let someone have it, but when it's with me they take it and throw it in the trash and go ""sorry, trash goes in the trash. you can't take broken food. you're more than welcome to mark it out though :)""

Can, or where do I, report them for all of this?

starbucks,"As the title says, I put in a transfer request 2 months ago because I was moving off to college. I let my then-SM know, and found a store in my college town that was willing to accept me.

Right after I let my old SM know I was wanting to transfer, they left for another store. They weren't able to transfer me before they left, and them leaving pretty much put my old store into SM purgatory. From the moment they left to until when I moved, we never had a permanent SM. We alternated between being watched over by an ASM-in-training, an SM-in-training, and an SM of another store in our district that was training to be DM. Despite this, I was assured multiple times that my transfer would be completed in time for me to move. 

That didn't happen, though. To this day, I'm still in the system as working at my old store. I bothered the shit out of everyone I could think of, hoping that *someone* could help me transfer, but to no avail. I was told that since my old store doesn't officially have an SM, no one has ""access""  to transfer me except the DM, who seems either unable or unwilling to.

To make matters worse, the SM at my new store told me that I would start this week but I've only worked two shifts so far and I'm currently not scheduled *at all* for this week, next week, or the week after. My new SM says he'll fix it, but that was a couple of days ago and nothing's changed. I texted him again earlier today and haven't heard anything back.

I'm really fucking stressed about it and don't know what to do. My new store is low-volume and cafe-only, so I'm scared that there just isn't enough room to fit me into the schedule. I'm also scared that my new SM is already sick of dealing with me and doesn't want me to work at his store anymore.

I'm not really in the position where I can afford to not work for 2-3 weeks/indefinitely. I honestly really enjoy working at Starbucks - the pay is decent compared to similar jobs, getting off at 11 or 12 is really convenient as a college student, and I'm good at my job.

starbucks,"Hi, I‚Äôve been officially hired by Starbucks since 7/25 of this year, I didn‚Äôt begin my actual training until a few weeks later and now this is my final week of training. 

Originally, I inquired about getting a job at Starbucks because there‚Äôs a billion of them everywhere. I was scheduled to move in December of this year, and it would‚Äôve been an easy job to pickup in my new town. Now, my move is coming much sooner. My S/O was expecting a move with a new big-girl office job later in the year (December) but now it‚Äôs happening in October, before my 3 months are finished at Starbucks. 

I was curious what my options are? I‚Äôm scared to bring any of this up to my SM or anyone in case of any type of ill-will or retaliation of some sort. My store is very understaffed and several other partners made it clear I was being rushed through training. I also of course do feel bad ditching them so soon especially since everyone there has been incredibly nice to me. Idk if Starbucks as a corporation will see me as a waste of their time and decide I‚Äôm not reliable enough to rehire. 

Should I tell my SM about my new life changes? Should I put in my 2-weeks a week or two before my 3 months have finished? What issues would this cause for me? Would I have to start training all over again at a new store in my new city? Would Starbucks even hire me again after this?

starbucks,"I recently just quit my job at Starbucks after two years of working there. We had a new manager who failed to schedule people correctly. I struggled to get 25 hours a week and needed 40 but on my days off, I would be asked to cover a shift. After working 9 days in a row I felt extremely burnt out and forgot I worked the next working and slept in past my shift start time. My manager called me two hours after I was supposed to start and when he did, I grabbed my shoes and ran out the door. Just to get there with a Final Write up waiting for me:) (I had never been written up before or been given any verbal warning). Aside from all the janky scheduling, this man was just RUDE. The picture in this thread is him making fun of my forehead/scar. I also was made fun of for my shoes, makeup, etc BY HIM. I was constantly bullied there and was even told to put a little pep in my step and look like i‚Äôm doing something because ‚Äúi was walking too slow‚Äù because I had massive blisters on my feet from my new work shoes. He would also be scheduled for a certain time but then not come in until 4 hours later ‚Äújust because he felt like it‚Äù or because ‚Äúhe picked up an extra shift that week‚Äù. I could list so many things this man has said and done but I would never stop talking. How do I get him fired!?",Manager from hell:)
starbucks,"There‚Äôs a woman I am extremely uncomfortable serving now. She‚Äôs been a regular to my store for almost a year, always gets the same grande pike with 8 sugars and steamed cream. Last Friday, we had a super busy evening and the urns were all in the middle of getting urnexed by someone who went home sick. The Karen came in and ordered her usual, I make a pour over because I don‚Äôt want to risk poisoning her with urnex because we have no idea what point in the cleaning routine any of the urns are at. I went heavier than she‚Äôd liked with the cream and she asked me to top it off with more coffee. I tell her we don‚Äôt have any brewed so I can either remake it if she‚Äôd like or add a shot. She got really pissed off, said ‚ÄúNo, thank you‚Äù and stormed off and literally *threw her fucking drink all over all the cafe trashes*. At this point in my head I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs gonna go home and call corporate, my coworkers are shocked. I tried to be accommodating, we had no usable urns, and all I could do was either redo the pour over or add a shot like I offered. Thought that encounter was over with, but she came through my drive thru tonight and ordered the cream and sugar on the side. At the DT window, my coworker asks her why she‚Äôs ordering it on the side now. The Karen starts going off about how the other day a barista didnt get her drink right and how it took every ounce of her being not to throw her drink in my face and she starts describing what I look like. When I started ringing up another customer from the box at the DT, she saw me and hid her face. I truly hope she was embarrassed that I heard that she was talking to my coworker about how much she wanted to disfigure my face with hot coffee because her cream wasn‚Äôt light enough one time out of the year I‚Äôve been making her stupid ass 3 dollar drink. With the way she reacted with the cafe trash, I truly believe she wanted to throw it in my face, and I feel extremely uncomfortable ever interacting with her ever again.

Stop recording your baristas. Whether they're making your drink, handing you your drink, taking your order, etc. Stop it.

It's downright rude and a blatant invasion of privacy. Yes, your drink is pretty. Take a photo AFTER handoff. 

Additionally, drive thrus NEED to install cameras to protect baristas. I KNOW that can't be the only person who has come across 'public flashing' p*rn that directly involves unknowing baristas. 

Baristas love making coffee. Baristas hate being dehumanized. Be fucking kind and act like a decent, well mannered human. 

(also, to that infamous lady 'asking' baristas to use her dropshipped AliExpress blender, you're weird as hell. baristas can't and won't say no to you because they jnow they'll receive backlash for 'not making the moment right')

starbucks,"Hi there! Something happened today that made me feel a little weird about my drink order. For reference, my mom has ordered her green tea frap this same way for years, so that‚Äôs where I got it from.

My order has been a caramel Frappuccino w/ extra ice, extra caramel, double blended &amp; in a venti cup. 

Usually I‚Äôll order and I don‚Äôt get any feedback and if I‚Äôm at a new Starbucks I preface it by saying I have a complicated order just in case. I don‚Äôt order if the line is long and I never complain if it‚Äôs not in a venti cup. I do not expect the cup to be full. I do expect to be charged for extra caramel. If there was a charge for the cup, I have paid that, too. I work in retail so my ice melts in the back room while I‚Äôm assisting guests. The extra ice helps my drink last a while longer. 

Today I ordered and after reading back my order, I asked the barista if she heard me ask for a venti cup. It flashed on the screen a couple of times like she couldn‚Äôt find the right button, so when she told me to pull up, I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. When I get to the window, it‚Äôs in a grande cup. I didn‚Äôt complain or anything but after reading a bit here I am wondering if that was intentional? 

I don‚Äôt want to be a bad customer. Can I make this less annoying for them? Should I go drop off some chocolates for being annoying? Idk??

starbucks,"How long does ethics give decision after the investigation?

This will be a pretty long story/rant. Please try to understand as English is not my first language 

2 partners filed an ethics complaint plus 2 incident reports (a witness report and a green bean) against the same SSV.

SSV apparently called a partner from a minority a slave. Partner reported the incident to the manager but manager just shrugged the incident off and even told the partner to not tell it to other partners as manager is afraid that other partners will get mad at ssv and will bully ssv. We already knew that this SSV and SM are particularly close and lets SSV gets away from any complaints. Instead of giving SSV corrective action or coaching for the racism issue, SM nitpicks on the partner for every little thing even some things aren't true. There was also a second time with the same partner where SSV asked if partner lives on a gh**to area. Partner also reported the incident but nothing was done. So we convinced partner to call ethics instead. Partner was able to talk to the DM before they moved to another province. Partner later found out that our SM called the store sm that they're going to transfer to and said bad things about partner to prevent partner from being accepted to the store.

Another ethics complaint and 2 IR are related.
SSV aggressively followed a green bean from inside the store to the parking lot and yelled at green bean in front of many customers and partners which I feel is against third place policy and anti-harassment. Even though green bean didn't notify ssv (which SSV IS hardly on the floor working) that GB clocked out, SSV should just coach GB properly. GB told the incident to SM but blamed GB instead on how GB is being inconsiderate and non-cooperative. GB told another SSV about what happened and felt it was unfair so they filed a complaint for GB. GB and other witnesses also filed incident reports which notified our SM and it pissed our SM off. The investigation started 2 weeks ago where DM asked people who filed the ir and complaints as well as other baristas.


  Many partners also talked to SSV and SM directly on how SSV is being aggressive and acting like a bully to other partners(especially green beans) instead of coaching them properly but nothing happens to ssv instead SM nitpicks/blames partners who complains about SSV and sometimes would cut their hours.


TL;DR 
Partners filed ethics complaints and incident reports against the same SSV for racism and being a bully towards green beans. Partners tried to have a talk several times with SSV and SM for the aggressive behavior but no corrective action is taken and SM is always covering up SSV.  Investigation was started 2-3 weeks ago and partners are losing hope that the results will still fall into SSV's favor. How long will it take till they would release the decision if they're going to transfer the SSV?",SSV who is racist and a bully to partners especially green beans

starbucks,"Depending on how liberal you use the word. 2 months may not be considered new to you but I feel like there's still so much for me to learn. One major one being social interactions lol. 

You see that ""Lol""? I added that to lighten the *mood* but I really feel like things are getting bad. Id consider myself a ugly duckling. Wasn't the most pleasing guy to look and the ugly friend of my group when I was younger to Being told by men and women I'm really good looking often and all my friends sort of following my lead. All that is cool and all but it causes a lot of unwanted attention for a man who still hasn't left their ugly duck mindset.

It may seems like I'm being braggadocios I apologize if anyone is taking it that way but I'm only pointing this out because I feel like its effecting my work. So as we all know Starbucks is a very female dominated brand. From the customers to the staff (At least in my store) I'm starting to have women compliment me a lot. Which is so cool because I know a lot of people are shy but I have no idea how to respond without being awkward.

 I don't want to come off as unapproachable but I keep messing these things up dude. A lot of the time I wouldn't mind having a conversation with these folks but I get shy around new people and overthink. I don't want to get fired over this. Most of my partners are great people but a select few feel like I'm favored by our manager and critique everything I do. Starbucks is supposed to be a social place! My manger is the best she always gives me reassurance but I'm starting to think that's just because she may fancy me (Not just based of that, there are other things I don't need to go in detail about)

 I don't want anyone to think I'm unapproachable or stuck up when I'm really just to in my own head. I have a fellow barista who is pretty cute she looks like Zoe Kravitz who's my celebrity crush. This girl has thrown me so many ""Just fucking interact with me you curly headed bastard"" signs and tried sparking conversations and I still overthink saying a simple hi and bye to her

You may read that thinking *""how can you know all this and not be confident enough to converse""* and it comes down to being that guy who would think someone is flirting with him when they were actually doing the complete opposite. I'm not dumb after awhile I can start to tell this isn't just them being nice but Id rather deny and be safe then sorry.

I hope this didn't come off too dating advice-ey Because at the end of the day my fear comes from losing my job and intimidating others, not loss of possible dates. 

Are there any other long term shy partners out there? Or shy barista turned into a outgoing one? Id love some advice from both sides I don't plan to be like this forever",New Barista S.O.S (long read)

I really just want the old recipe, 3 shots of espresso shaken with 3 pumps of white mocha, with a splash of milk/cream on top. But whenever I try to modify the drink, it still is always SOOO milky!

Ex-partner x2 here. I worked at Starbucks 2013-2018, then Mar 2021 - Oct 2021 before landing (what I thought was) a more stable full time job. 

Spoiler alert: it was not.

Now I‚Äôm thinking about returning to Starbucks. I will say, I definitely enjoyed my time during my first five years more than I enjoyed it this last time. With the recipe changes, new policies, COVID, it wasn‚Äôt my favorite - plus I was starting at an EXTREMELY high volume store for our area, and they didn‚Äôt really train me again because I‚Äôd spent five years with the company previously. (Which is whatever, but things had changed, so it would‚Äôve been nice to know them beforehand and not told them while doing something wrong on the floor.)

I don‚Äôt think the pay has changed for every store in my area, though. Last year, I was making $13 for the few months I spent as a SSV, but I know they were talking about raising pay. I see barista postings on indeed around here from $10-$15 an hour, so who knows. 

But I‚Äôm only making $16 now, they‚Äôre cutting my hours, and I‚Äôm considering moving back to the bux and working my way up this time. As long as I can find a location around me paying at least $15.

SO. Baristas and SSVs of Reddit, how are we liking it nowadays? I know the company is under a lot of fire for the union stuff, but as a day to day job, how are we feeling? Pros/cons? Advice? Etc?

i felt so awkward so i said ""oh just tryna pour my hot drink in"" and before i even finished the sentence he cut me off ""you don't need to explain to me"", and said nothing else. i was so uncomfortable that i asked ""should i pay now"" and he said no feeling so annoy.

It was ironic because before I took his order there was already a line ??? It honestly destroys how much I enjoy this job and I find it really annoying.

starbucks,"So today I was given a written warning for time and attendance which had verifiably false information on it. It said they received the call at 4:40 for my shift starting at 5:30 which by ""Starbucks standards"" is not acceptable because it is within an hour which is not proper advance notice. Only problem is I have proof on my phone of the call logs where I had called the store at 4:28am and talked to the shift letting them know I was having diarrhea and could not come in. Mind you, I woke up only at 4:20am and as soon as I could upon feeling that I was sick and having these issues. Issues that are against food and safety procedures and a major health code violation.   


So, I showed my phone logs to my SM, who then told me that it is ""still within that hour"" and upheld the written warning. Apparently, he thinks I'm stupid enough to believe 62 minutes is less than 60 minutes of notice, or that somehow the policy changed and even though everyone has been told ""1 hour"" over and over and over again, it's now no longer 1 hour?  


And now I am at home, about to call up the business ethics and compliance number to clear my name and get this written off my name because it not only affects my job security, but an upcoming planned transfer across the country. Unless I am blind, the attendance and punctuality policy does not state any specific time period for the ""advanced notice"" so is this just some fluid number that managers can make up on the spot to screw you over? Because, like I've said, I've always been told 1 hour. By my former manager, by this manager, and I've had a written warning before (which was justified maybe) as I had called off only 30 minutes before my shift in an emergency and he reiterated that it had to be 1 hour of advanced notice.   


So I did exactly that. I woke up, felt sick, had diarrhea, called off 1 hour and 2 minutes ahead of my scheduled shift, and now I am being written up. What the hell can I do?

So much so my store qualified for a new managers assistant. 

No I didn‚Äôt expect to get promoted. The way it was explained  to me, I‚Äôm basically waiting in line before an arbitrary time, like a year or something before they allow me to really advance beyond maybe a trainer. 

But instead of promoting one of the many qualified and capable veterans locally she hired some random new guy she said has ‚Äúprevious management experience‚Äù I meet him, and talk for like 2 minutes. Apparently what she meant to say is by ‚Äúprevious management experience‚Äù is that he‚Äôs fresh from the army (not an officer mind you) just a regular army guy, young guy, my age. I guess ‚Äúprevious management experience‚Äù sounds better than ‚Äútroopers skip the line peasant.‚Äù Like, if the guy had some retail experience managing a McDonald‚Äôs or something, I could reconcile that. But I was showing this guy how the register worked and it was clear he was super green to retail as an industry. 

I feel so‚Ä¶..hurt. Deflated. Again i did not expect to get the promotion. But Expected my new superior to be‚Ä¶more qualified than me? Like I‚Äôm sure the army has given him skills. But I doubt they are starbies retail skills. He‚Äôs this newbie just trying to soak in everything. Just like me a couple months ago. And like, what about my fellow more experienced partners? It just makes me feel like our hard work is worthless. Just cogs waiting for someone from a higher social caste to be privileged the boons of our hard work!

starbucks,"At mine we‚Äôre expected to do front AND ovens while also doing all of our shift tasks. 
This is a lot, especially during the morning until around 11 because ovens tend to be nonstop and cafe can get busy. 

This is too much. I feel like I‚Äôm doing the work of 3 people, and when we‚Äôre understaffed then I‚Äôm doing the work of 4 bc we need restocks/ice/cleaning. 

I personally feel like a shift should be planted on CS so they can resolve issues without disrupting flow, step away to do their tasks without interruptions, have more time to focus on partner breaks and plays, etc. 

I‚Äôm tempted to bring it up during my next shift meeting. I absolutely dread working mornings because of this. It‚Äôs too much. So I‚Äôm curious, what positions are SSVs at your store typically planted on?",What positions do shift supervisors at your store work?

starbucks,"This may not go over well but I have to get this off my chest. Let me start off with: we all know hours are getting cut and there isn‚Äôt enough coverage ever anymore. It sucks and I‚Äôm tired of doing the work of 3 and I know a lot of you guys are as well, it‚Äôs a shitty situation to be in. But at my store we have a lot of baristas that view this job as just something to do because they‚Äôre bored. Most of them that have this mindset are 30-40 year olds and don‚Äôt actually need this job, which they make VERY clear (they used to be stay at home moms mostly). They only work maybe 8-10 hours a week give or take. They‚Äôve all been here a year and still cannot sequence or make drinks properly (they‚Äôve been given plenty of practice and coaching I promise) they also cannot really work any position with any sort of excellence and it‚Äôs getting VERY frustrating to pick up their slack every 5 minutes that I‚Äôm on the floor with them. So even with the lack of coverage needed I‚Äôm still getting the barista here that cannot or just flat out refuse to do their job with any sort of urgency. They don‚Äôt ask questions, they shirk off standards and I have to deal with a lot of angry customers because of them. They‚Äôre taking away hours from people that need and/or want them and taking up space from baristas that are actually competent at the job (that have been there the same amount of time). Am I being a jerk? I‚Äôve tried to give them a lot of grace but I‚Äôm already doing more work because of the lack of coverage and I don‚Äôt want to be doing even more just because a few baristas don‚Äôt want to do their job (they all get scheduled for peak to mid btw). I know I‚Äôm a shift and i need to be the one to make up for certain things, but I really wish I didn‚Äôt have to hold their hands all the time, they‚Äôve been here a YEAR I give them practice in every position, every chance I get, but there is no sense of urgency and I‚Äôll coach on standard (and so will some other baristas) and they just shrug it off and then I have to deal with an angry customer. 

Seriously am I being a huge jerk? I just don‚Äôt want to have to keep holding the hand of a barista that doesn‚Äôt even care about the job.  I know it‚Äôs just a job and not that serious but I get chewed out by my SM when a barista isn‚Äôt doing their job properly.",Trenta rant of a very burnt out ssv

starbucks,[removed],Dress code update?
starbucks,"For context, I was hired in late July. I've worked a few weeks now, coming up on a month. I'm only scheduled around 20 hrs/week. I'm still learning and not comfortable yet with everything. Most of the longtime employees have been really nice and understanding, except one. I don't know maybe we got off on the wrong foot or I'm reading him wrong. I'll just give some examples. One day, I was on cold bar making fraps. It came peak time when everyone started ordering fraps. I ran out of base and frap chips. I needed them for the next fraps so I'm running around frantically trying to restock while there's a line of cups forming with frap labels. He comes over, sees the line of cups, says ""You need to be sequenc- nevermind, just go on your 10"" and takes over. I just said ""I'm sorry"", changed out the empty bases for him and then went on break. I watched him from the end of the bar slam through the fraps I failed to make. He forcefully slammed the blender cover with each frap. It felt really passive agressive. After that day, everytime I've worked with him as shift lead he puts me on DT. I feel like I'm being punished for that one bad day. Anyway, this last time I was on DT he was watching me all shift. All day he just kept chiming in with unhelpful advice. I'm not comfortable yet taking orders while away from the POS but he keeps telling me to start taking orders while I'm putting pastries in the oven or doing something else. ""It takes some memorization"" he said. Which felt so condescending and like he just wants to flex his skills over me. Also that day, I was bent over counting change for a customer at the window and he's standing there over me and tells me again that I need to start taking the order at the speaker box. My mind can't processing counting change and listening to the customer at the speaker box ordering a venti iced white mocha, quad shot, blonde, ristretto, 4 pumps toffee nut, whatever the fuck else. I had been welcoming them and telling we'd be with them in a moment. I don't understand how you're supposed to take the order at the speaker box and be personable to the customer at the window. If I'm listening/talking with customer over the headset, the most I can do is hand drinks to the customer at the window and smile. All day he made the same comments that I need to ""multitask"", when I'm obviously not comfortable doing that yet. I don't reply which I think pisses him off more. The most I say to him is ""Oh, okay. Thanks."" I went in today on my day off to get coffee. He was working. Others working said hi to me. I know he had to have seen me in the cafe. Then he didn't even read my name on my drink and just called out my order. I vented to my mom about all of this and she just told me ""you're going to work with assholes everywhere you work"". Which is probably true. I'm hoping honestly he'll just go away. He boasts about possibly moving away in a few months to a bigger city and getting a ""real job"". Which again is so douchey and condescending. He acts like he's above the rest of us. I wanted to tell him you jackass, you and I working here in the same place, just trying to get by like everyone else. I could go on and on about every interaction that's irked me about him, but I feel like I've go on too long already.",Advice for dealing with a passive agressive shift lead?

I see the basket by the big grinder machine (I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs really called!).  I pick the one in front (touching only the one I grabbed ‚Äî this may be important info).  I‚Äôm fairly short and the basket was in easy reach.   I say to the closest barista something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking a sleeve; thanks!‚Äù  And the barista says to me ‚ÄúI wish you hadn‚Äôt done that.

With that out of the way, for those that suffer from mental health ailments, I want to say, our benefits do not help us or those who suffer. None of their medical plans offer any options with mental health, NONE. So, if you have or can gain state medical, do it! You‚Äôll have a better chance of receiving help rather than paying X amount to find out that you do not qualify. Lyra is only good for those that have minor issues and can use simple one on one therapy sessions, but some of us need more than just that, like DBT services, medication, etc.   


So in other words, we sign up for what? Spend our money on what? The company earned 8.1 billion last year and these are the services offered to us? They barely give a pay raise to any of the states, hire someone to union bust, and this is also what we receive, the bare minimum! What a great company that operates behind fallacy, a false notion of ‚ÄúHappy Partners create Happy Customers‚Äù.  

If you cannot pay us a livable wage you might as well give us better benefits, if not, then we are below min. Wage slaves.   


If this is how they treat us, the people who made their billions, then I do not mind taking matter into my own hands and teaching people how to make better coffee, espresso pulls, cold brew, etc. from their own home at a fraction of the cost. Their beans aren‚Äôt the greatest, they continually tell the customers that they are ‚ÄúHand Picked‚Äù, ‚Äúbest quality ever‚Äù, and ‚Äúyou cannot compare their economical resourcing and safe practices‚Äù. If you must know, they are hand picked, but by whom? People they pay even less than us. Their quality is subpar to grocery store beans that aren‚Äôt properly stored, some blends are way too oily and others are way too dry, some you can tell have been expired before their date, you can obviously tell they aren‚Äôt properly handled! Their economical safe practices are unethical, the people who farm the beans do not live happily, actually the vast majority of them still live in poverty!   


You can create better quality drinks at home from local roasters or online sources that roast their beans with more heart than these soulless bloodsuckers! You can steam milk using a modified Moka pot, or you can buy a stove top steamer, and use a Moka pot for your espresso beans, you can create your own syrups at a fraction of the cost! Cold brews are super easy to make and you can make them even stronger than what the company offers!! Hot coffee and iced coffee is far cheaper to brew at home than to shop at the company. Starbucks quality is a scam, with heavily processed sugar syrups, you pay for the cups and not the coffee, the cups, lids, straws, utensils cost more than the beans!!! 

Just because the company is advertised and is popular, doesn‚Äôt mean they are ethically safe, economically great, and overall the best option. It might be time for folks to learn how to do things on their own again and not rely of convenience; convenience, cups, utensils, bags, etc. is the only thing you are truly paying for! Btw, the more you support major coffee companies like this, you are furthering the extinction of the beans itself.

starbucks,"Well, I guess since my last post did well I‚Äôll keep on posting so I keep getting the hang of this Reddit thing. 

We recently had to ban a customer. Here‚Äôs why:
I was on cafe bar making the orders and I‚Äôm about to start one and the guy goes ‚Äúhey hey hey hold on. I‚Äôm gonna walk you through how to make my drink‚Äù
Proceeds to bark orders at me. He wanted me to make the iced latte with no ice and then slowly take that and pour it over a cup of ice and squeeze the cup as I did it. Any time I would go too quickly he would yell at me and say go slower. All so he can have a extra half scoop of ice on top. I‚Äôm the shift but with situations where it‚Äôs me making the drink and getting yelled at I freeze up. So I told myself next time I would not let it happen again. 
Apparently he‚Äôs a regular I never have to deal with and everyone is scared of him. 

The next time he did the same thing, said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna help you make it‚Äù 
I ignored him. He told me to fill the milk to the second line and I said ‚Äúyou mean the standard procedure?‚Äù And he didn‚Äôt really know how to respond. After that I ignored him. I made it the way you‚Äôre supposed to and he went ‚Äúwait WAIT WAIT‚Äù I said ‚Äúwhat was that?‚Äù And handed him his drink and a cup of ice on the side. He didn‚Äôt really know what to do at that point so he left. 

I told my store manager about this guy because it had been getting out of hand. 

I wasn‚Äôt here for the thing that got him banned tHANNK GOD. But he came in and did it to a barista and was leaning over yelling while playing with a knife very close to her. Basically threatening her to make the drink correctly. And then she didn‚Äôt make it exactly how he wanted and another barista tried to remake it and the customer proceeded to scream and cuss everyone out, pointing the knife at them, and leave. Came back in and threw the drink and then called several times screaming and cussing. Banneddddd bebeee.

starbucks,"This might be kinda lengthy so sorry in advance. 

July 5th or so I sprained my ankle pretty bad and have been on work restrictions of only working 4 hours maximum per shift per doctors orders. My SM keeps scheduling me for over the 4 hours that I am allowed to work and expecting me to find the coverage for the remainder of my shift, which to me is not right or fair because he knows I‚Äôm only supposed to work 4 hours. 

About two weeks ago he wrote me up due to attendance, which I thought was reasonable (to an extent because I did use some sick time for said call offs) because I did have a problem like 2-3 months ago with attendance due to some mental health issues. 

Fast forward to this week I‚Äôm on the schedule for 5.75 hours for Monday and Tuesday yet again. He sends me home on Monday at the 4 hour mark without a problem. Tuesday he‚Äôs working from home, but my shift sends me home at the 4 hour mark as well. Wednesday he comes in and says ‚Äúwhat happened yesterday? Why did you leave early?‚Äù I kept my cool and calmly stated ‚Äúbecause I can only work 4 hours per doctors orders, but you‚Äôve known this for over a month now‚Äù his response was ‚Äúthis schedule was already made before you went on restrictions, you need to start getting the rest of the shifts covered that you are scheduled over your allotted time‚Äù he makes the schedule MAYBE 2-3 weeks in advance if that, so it definitely wasn‚Äôt made before I went on restrictions. He then said that he has spoken to our regional manager and they have both agreed that we need to ‚Äúget this figured out‚Äù (I have an MRI scheduled for today so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm just not trying to figure out what is really going on with my ankle) but he hasn‚Äôt given me any help or direction on how he wants me to figure it out. 

So fast forward again to yesterday, I go in and he‚Äôs doing the normal ‚Äúhow are you feeling? Do you feel sick?‚Äù I told him that I think I ate something the night before that didn‚Äôt agree with my stomach because it hurt pretty bad, and also told him that my ankle was in a tremendous amount of pain, so I might not be 100% my usual self or as fast as usual but I‚Äôm there and I‚Äôm pushing through. He EXPLODED on me and literally said, and I quote ‚Äú you can‚Äôt go home early, you‚Äôre out of sick time. I‚Äôve been using your sick time when you clock out early and there‚Äôs no coverage.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even imply that I was trying to go home early for one. For two, I NEVER gave him permission to use my PROTECTED sick time for me ‚Äúleaving early‚Äù.  I was under the impression that sick time was only to be used if you wrote it in the book that you wanted to use it or if the SM asked you and you said yes. Is that not correct?

2. The quality of coffee beans is consistently poor. They /could/ get fantastic tasting beans, and better brewing standards but instead we get over roasted shlock, but of course it cuts into their profits.
3. Lousy pay - 50 cents above minimum wage is super gaming the system, hella not cool. Especially in larger cities, and richer areas.

starbucks,"Some backstory: So about a 4 months ago my store got a new Assistant Store Manager, then a month ago my store got a new Store Manager. Both of them being outside hires that have never worked for Starbucks before. 

So today i was in the middle of training some baristas for the store that is about to open near us and in walks my manager and he asks to talk to me for a minute. I walk to the front where they were sitting and he basically starts explaining to me that i have to sign a corrective action paper because i called out for 5 days a month ago. The reason i called out is because my little brother (16) had been rushed to the hospital due to his Crohn‚Äôs Disease. This hospital being over an hour away and my mom not being able to miss work because she‚Äôs a manager made it so i was the only one able to stay with him. So i called my ASM (we had yet to meet the new SM) and explain my situation. She tells me that it‚Äôs okay considering i was only scheduled to be training and to keep her updated. Well the following Monday i go back to work and i have a doctors note from the hospital explaining why i was out. I logged my sick time and it was signed and approved no problem. (As we are allowed to use sick time towards helping immediate family) So i guess i‚Äôm just confused on why i was given a Corrective Action Form for a issue that happened over a month ago for something my manager knew about and that i wasn‚Äôt able to control? 

Another thing, i‚Äôve been with the company for almost a year this month on the 30th and the new store i mentioned is in need of a Shift Supervisor. I applied and when i was given this Corrective Action Form my manager informed me that it won‚Äôt damage my possibly for the position but i can‚Äôt help but be concerned especially since with my brother‚Äôs disease everything is unexpected. Should i be worried?",Had To sign a Corrective Action Form today.

starbucks,Got my usual trenta passion fruit iced tea lemonade at my usual Starbucks and it tasted and smelled STRONGLY of bubblegum. I called and told the store.

starbucks,"TLDR: Does steaming vanilla bean powder clog the machine when steaming with milk? 

For the past probably 8+ years I've been ordering a Chai latte and over the years come to a specific order.
-Venti chai tea latte
-7 chai
-No water
-2 scoops vanilla bean powder steamed with the milk

I've had many baristas tell me they just steam it with the milk even when I don't ask but we moved to a new house and therefore a new store so I've made sure to order it that way. For the last 5 months they've made it and all of a sudden a new to me person tells me they can't steam the powder it clogs the machine but they can dump it in the Chai before adding milk.

So my question is does the vanilla bean powder actually clog the machine? Am I making way more work for baristas ordering this way? 

I'm frustrated that this one person after over 8 years of ordering keeps saying something no one else in this (or any) store has ever said.  I didn't just come up with ordering this way, baristas told me they steamed the milk or offered to before I ever tried to order it that way.",A question for Baristas

 I don't really care which location I visit as there are always a few ""on the way"" to my destination. It would be nice if there were a ""busy location"" indicator.

My situation is‚Ä¶ unique I guess you can say.

I am a business administration major at my university (not ASU). I took accounting and liked it enough that I wanted to major in it. Unfortunately, my university would only allow it if I took additional courses. My financial aid does cover tuition‚Ä¶ and unfortunately I‚Äôm almost at my max year (6 years is the limit I suppose). I would have to pay out of pocket eventually and I can‚Äôt afford that. 

When I heard ASU offered accounting, I didn‚Äôt quit Starbucks to receive the benefit. I applied for accounting as my first choice. They made me pick a second choice just in case and did business administration. 

Unfortunately, I only got in business administration and not accounting. I was sad lol. 

I checked the requirements (I have a high GPA for my university, so I was confused on what‚Äôs going on and I had over 60 credits which they require you have 30 or more college credits). Turns out I need a pretty high GPA for High School as well. Or have a high SAT score‚Ä¶ even be 8% of the graduate class? That was wild to me‚Ä¶ but long story short I didn‚Äôt turn in a high school transcript and maybe that‚Äôs why I was rejected? I accidentally mistook corporate accounting (does not need high school transcripts) with normal accounting (which does need HS transcripts). 

Luckily for me, high school GPA must be 3.4 to be considered. I graduated with low honors with a 3.5 GPA‚Ä¶ maybe 3.6 can‚Äôt remember it well. I believe my school GPA system was the same as Arizona‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not 100% sure. 

I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll turn in the transcript and still be rejected or if it‚Äôs too late. 

Is there something else I could do? I heard about pathway to admission helping partners boost their GPA to get admitted. Maybe that could help me? Or is it only for certain situations? 

Has anyone else been in this situation ? 

Any advice is appreciated!

When you're ordering coffee, Latte, Cold Brew, Ice Coffee, Americanos.  **STATE THAT YOU WANT CREAM/MILK/SUGAR**. 

 It's been 3 flipping years since stores have taken their cream, milk, sugar section away.  My tongue is TIRED of uttering the words "" Anything in that?"" and then being met with incomprehensible/undecisive ""*Oh uh..  uh let me text my coworker, this isn't mine*!"" or the "" *Oh, you guys put it in?*"" Like, ***Richard***, you come here every other day?? 

And even worse, my baristas being met with the ""Oh I ASKED for this in my drink?""  Like, no, Bethany, you did not. Unless if I'm suddenly suffering a stroke or have an undiagnosed memory issue,  then I clearly remember you texting your GC on your phone and barely giving me eye contact. Like?

starbucks,"I prefer doing morning shifts because I have the rest of the day open for personal time/school/my second job, but oh my goodness do I hate my coworkers and shift leader. It sucks because the few times I do mid or night it makes me wanna change my availability because of how much I actually enjoy being there, but I can‚Äôt because it‚Äôll interfere too much with my busy schedule.

75% of my coworkers I open/morning with dislike me for whatever reason, that‚Äôs not the worst of it. To top it all off the main culprit of making my life a walking hell when I‚Äôm there is my shift leader, let‚Äôs call her R. I have been working for Starbucks for a year and a half, I‚Äôm a 298 partner and moved to my current store about two months ago. The first few shifts I worked with R was totally fine. I like to talk to my coworkers and get to know everybody and make conversation. She seemed like a nice person. Then one day I got food poisoning and had to leave early (I found coverage). She didn‚Äôt seem to care at ALL and while I was in the back resting drinking water almost passed out in pain she kept asking me to come back on the floor and getting annoyed when I told her I physically couldn‚Äôt. 

After that, it‚Äôs just got worse. Any little mistake or anything I do she makes comments on, and she‚Äôs even in front of me talked shit to another coworker assuming I didn‚Äôt know Spanish. Now most people in the morning crew hate me. I don‚Äôt care, but they‚Äôre so snarky about it. They all of a sudden treat me like a new partner even though I‚Äôve been there almost two years. Saying shit like ‚Äúoh would you feel comfortable going on bar later to get in some practice?‚Äù. I used to get moved around all positions but for the past few months every shift, and I mean EVERY shift I‚Äôve been put on DTR. Not even DTO. 

I know it‚Äôs not a me problem because every shift at least two customers come to me complaining about how rude R is. And she is! Blatantly rude to everyone, especially customers.

I like not having to do early mornings or late nights (12 AM) like I had to do at my last job. I cant imagine waking up at 4 am everyday to go work. Im not sure If I would be able to adjust to that time because Ive always been more of a night owl but I like having the whole day free to myself.  I really have open availability I just dont put it so that I dont get taken advantage of. I liked closing the store and setting up for the openers but they have a lot of down time and they run out of product a lot and I feel awkward being there after 2 sometimes.

- I want a coffee drink
- I typically order flavored lattes because I like sweetened coffee drinks with some milk in them. It doesn‚Äôt need to be a latte, but trying to give some context on my tastes
- Favorite flavors are chocolate, caramel, and vanilla (combos of any of these or variations are welcome)

starbucks,"So the store down the road from us is closed for renovations for 2 months so we got some of their borrowed partners. I came in to fill a shift today and saw 2 people that I had never seen before so I assumed they were borrowed partners (they were). Right as I get on the shift one of them is automatically complaining about hating being here and wanting to go home. Like?? What. And then she starts to get snippy and have an attitude with us.

At first I thought it was just me but she was being insanely bitchy to our shift lead (whom we all love she's amazing) for no reason. Listen, we all know it's against standard to have towels on the counters, but our store does it anyway because it's easier to pick up the mess. We keep them roughly hidden away in corners and also underneath our bars so that we can clean up every once in a while instead of having to run around to find a clean towel. 

She gets all up in our faces and basically snaps at us that it's not standard. And I'm like.. this isn't your damn store. I don't say anything but she's really pissing me off at this point. Anyways, so later I was on cold bar and put a towel on our cold bar frap roast pump because idk ab y'all but that shit literally leaks and sprays everywhere. About 10 seconds later I see the same girl had taken the towel off.. like wtf do you think it was there for.

Not only did she keep moving shit and complaining about how she hated it here. She was just being snippy and snarky about literally everything and interrupting me while I was helping customers and shit. She even opened a new till on the second register just cuz she ""scanner wasn't working"" without even consulting the shift. Like wtf. You can't just do that.

The second girl got all pissy when I told her that we hand out cafe drinks in a specific spot and mobiles in another since we are cafe only.. like dude half the customers couldn't find their drinks bc you put them where they don't go. 

Overall I did not have fun with how these girls were acting and parading around like it was THEIR STORE. I've literally been a borrowed partner for their store and another store I'm transferring to and NEVER act like that. 

To top it all of this girl has been working since February, the same time I started working. Where in the hell do you think you have authority over ANY of us??

TLDR; a girl who was a borrowed partner was running the store like she was the shift lead and don't a bunch of shit she wanted to to her way instead of following what our store does.",can borrowed partners stop acting like they run the place

I‚Äôve been going to my local since September 2021 since my wife and I started a business together. Coffee is essential to our day. We started going to our local DT. We visited nearly every day, and now this year it‚Äôs once every other day.

The shift manager, she is an absolute delight! Even when there is cars behind us, she always chats to us, goes the extra mile and always makes our day. We always leave saying ‚Äòabsolutely love her!‚Äô 

When things have gone wrong with orders, even when we order on Uber Eats for delivery and it‚Äôs wrong. We go and see her, she fixes everything. 

When it‚Äôs been busy and we‚Äôve placed a mobile order on the app and go through the drive thru, she comes out, asks what our order was and makes it in advance so it‚Äôs quicker for us. 9/10, she‚Äôll upgrade our drinks to large no charge. She‚Äôll give us snacks sometimes too even though we‚Äôre always wanting to pay for it!

I just thought of posting my experience here, as I‚Äôve sent an email saying how much she is a credit to the store with no reply, so I wanted to inform other partners on here, that you do makes customers days.

When you order ahead via Starbucks app, it literally prompts you to ask your barista for your mobile order giving your name when you get to the store.

But never expect us to call out your drinks when you mobile order. Sometimes it might be very busy with lots of drinks to make where we wouldn‚Äôt notice anyone coming in, you just sit at the lobby thinking we would call out your drink like we call out in-store orders, then you complain you been waiting for 30 minutes for your order when you was supposed to let us know you‚Äôre here for your mobile order. Generally, we call out in-store orders, and we put mobile orders to a space where we store mobile orders until customers come pick up their mobile order.

starbucks,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub.

I (MtF 20) decided not to work at Starbuck's after six days of training. I kind of regret it because I think it could've gone easier with time, but I also was feeling really overwhelmed. 

On half of the days of my training, I didn't have a lot of guidance because we were understaffed. I was working the register on my own on day four. I have a lot of anxiety which makes it hard to remember and concentrate under pressure and my coworkers / shift supervisor were critical when I couldn't remember the order of tasks while in each position. They said that they didn't expect me to remember everything but after a day or two it felt like they did.

However, I think a big part of my experience might've just been me interpreting things in a negative way. I have low self-esteem and now I'm thinking I should've just stayed and toughed it out, and that it would've gotten easier. But I don't think that after telling the store manager that I couldn't handle the job based on six days of training (four hours each) she will be thrilled to take me back after just two days of reflection. I also would feel a little embarrassed even if they did take me back, considering that we didn't even get to me learning how to make drinks.

It also was difficult because everyone there ignored my pronoun pin (meaning they gendered me incorrectly), but I didn't specifically introduce myself with pronouns so I guess that's not really anyone's fault?

Should I just move on and try to get a job somewhere else, and then just come back after a year or two and advocate for myself citing personal growth and job experience? I think that this job might be very important to me in the future as a source of health benefits.

I got my first Karen yesterday and the experience just sucked the absolute life out of me. It was my mistake and I profusely apologize but she kept calling me a horrible and terrible person. 

What happened was we had one last chocolate cake pop left but I forgot that this other mom asked for it. So when the Karen came up to my till and asked for it, I told her that we had one left and she was all happy for it. Then I realized the cake pop was for the other mom and I told her. Her mood shifted so quick and she just started to get all angry. She ended up calling me a terrible person for not speaking up for myself and this just continued for a couple of minutes. When she asked for the cookies and cream cake pop, I told her that we were all out, which made the situation worse. She proceeds to call my store the worst store and says, ‚ÄúThis is so hard on the little ones!‚Äù I‚Äôm not entirely sure what she meant but I continued to smile and apologize.

They all start laughing with one saying, ‚Äúoh you did it again‚Äù. Now I am fully paying attention to them, girl gets up and walks over to handout and says in most sarcastic voice, ‚ÄúI am sorry I dropped my drink‚Äù.

Keep in mind lobby is extremely busy and looks like they are barely able to keep up, drive thru is so busy that cars are backing up on to the street, after 3-5 minutes here comes Barista with mop bucket/mop. 

She comes to them and says clean it up yourself I am tired of dealing with your mess or I am going to ban all of you forever. Girl that dropped her drink is no longer laughing and instead is now totally red. The other 2 still giggling thinking it‚Äôs all a joke. Barista goes back behind the counter leaving mop/mop bucket next to the girls. 1 min goes by, and I am thinking they are going to leave and not clean up the mess, finally after few minutes the girl gets up, wrings out the mop and start mopping. Took her few minutes to clean up as she did have to rinse out the mop few times. It looked like she did a good job cleaning up. She takes mop back and they give her replacement frap. Barista also said, ‚Äúyou drop it again and I am making you mop the lobby completely‚Äù in loud enough voice that I think everyone in the lobby was able to hear it. They left soon after that.

At my last store, I met an incredible shift supervisor that eventually got her own store as a manager &amp; has been waiting for me to work for her. She‚Äôs awesome and I thrive in her environment/working style. 

At the same time she got her store, I was being transferred for another reason (nothing negative), so I couldn‚Äôt go to the store I wanted. My stores management is too micromanaging, all that matters is drive thru times. I once spilled hot coffee on myself, at like 5am,  and no one cared if I was okay, they just took me off drive bar bc times were more important. Unless I‚Äôm working a closing shift, the environment feels too hostile and high strung.
 Anyway, I waited a few months before requesting to go to the store I prefer. My current SM said no because we were understaffed. Understandable. A few weeks later we got about 6 new hires. I waited for them to finish training &amp; get used to the store. When I asked again, my SM complained that I was late too many times. Clocking into my shifts way too late (when I was about a minute past my shift only twice, &amp; another time I was 27 minutes late because of car problems) she said she couldn‚Äôt be like ‚Äúoh yeah here you can have her at your store with all her problems‚Äù I was so shocked I didn‚Äôt even respond to that. I‚Äôm a good worker, I just want to be at a store where the manager actually likes me and respects me as a human being, not just another body to help get the drive thru times down.

Anyway, got my usual Starbucks yesterday and on my cup was written ""belly"". I'm relapsing with bulimia and had had a crappy morning, and this tipped me over the edge and I cried for longer than I would like to admit about it. It's my local store, I am in there a lot and, while I hadn't seen this particular barista before, I know most of the staff as my friend is a supervisor.

I know it's the schtick to give me a silly name, and I know that it probably wasn't meant to be anything mean, but I can't get it out of my head. I'm fat, I know I am, the last few years have been rough and it's messed up my recovery badly. I really don't want to tell my friend because I am embarrassed to admit that I am bulimic, but it's making me not want to go back to the store.

starbucks,"Let's be honest here; Starbucks is a mess right now.

From my time working there, and my time recently put, I thought about my experience and the company and wanted to put it here for anyone to read. Barista or Guest.

Here are my observations:

1 - The baristas work so hard for so little pay. Just after ordering 3 items, you have already spent what would be an hour made for a barista. Imagine the total of orders baristas make in an hour.

2 - The company's response to the unionizing is serious to their reputation and is only adding coal to a fire. If the trend continues, we might see a complete collapse of our brand.

3 - There is a fight between quality of transaction and quantity of transaction. We are mandated to meet ""customer connection"" but under a 30 second time frame to keep up with orders. Starbucks needs to pick one or the other and stop stressing our baristas out.

These are just some of my major concerns of the company. It would be nice to hear your thoughts.",The Company is a Mess

starbucks,"So, I‚Äôm a new SSV, haven‚Äôt even completed half of my modules. I was shown cash management, a few counts, the pastry pull, and how to run breaks. Luckily, I was being helped along this summer to be the new SSV so I had done the pulls and helped run breaks. Last night was my very first shift as SSV despite not having much training at all. 

I worked really hard and was happy to leave everything looking stocked and great. The baristas seemed happy with it. I took my time on all my shift tasks. The tills were counted, safe was counted, deposit with slip submitted, alarm on, doors locked‚Ä¶

I get a text this morning from the opening shift saying that 2/3 tills were fine and the safe was fine too. But the third cash was short -$80‚Ä¶ I said that there was no way. I was very thorough. It is possible that I miscounted but $80 worth? No way.

So I even went in to talk to the SSV who verified that the safe was fine but the Till was still short -$80. I‚Äôm really upset with this as I was meticulous on my close. I‚Äôve contacted my manager about it and will talk to them tomorrow. I‚Äôm hoping that it was somehow put in the deposit bag but to me it seems unlikely! I even went back into the store to check all of the pockets of our dirty aprons!

starbucks,"Sometimes the way people order food doesn‚Äôt match up with how workers are trained to take orders. A good example of this is when I go to Tim Hortons and order a bagel BELT. BELT stands for bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato. I don‚Äôt like bacon and I love veggies so I would always order a bagel BELT with no meat please. The response was always, ‚Äúso just egg and cheese?‚Äù At which point I would say, ‚ÄúI mean I want the vegetables too‚Äù then I would get what I want. But then the next time when asked, ‚Äúso just egg and cheese?‚Äù I would respond yup, and I‚Äôd get a bagel with just egg and cheese, no veggies. So then my next visit I‚Äôd ask for a bagel BELT and no bacon, but please leave the veggies on. This would confuse the worker and I‚Äôd have to explain that I want the egg cheese, lettuce tomato but no bacon. This became very frustrating because I knew there was a way to properly order without confusion. I finally found out what that magic combination of words is, Egg BELT. I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like an egg BELT.‚Äù No more confusion.

I have a similar problem at Starbucks. I want a cold sugar free drink. I do not want sugar free syrup. I simply want that sugar is not added to my drink. I like the passion tea. If I order passion tea. It comes hot. If I order a cold passion tea it comes with some sugar added and I‚Äôm always asked if I‚Äôd like to add lemonade. Then they always confirm that I want it ‚Äúwith water‚Äù. This I frustrating because in my world tea is automatically served with water. So after much discussion I got a passion tea, with water and ice. No sugar, no additives no lemonade. Good, I thought I understood. But I just ordered a cold passion tea. I said, please no sugar. After assuring them that I did not want lemonade, I do want water, I paid for my drink and left. But I just took a sip and it‚Äôs for sure sweet.

starbucks,"So I started at the end of February of this year, just after my store reopened with full hours (major staff shortage before I came). I was hired by a temporary SM from another store, and got a coffee tasting and an apron, whatever‚Ä¶.

And in the true spirit of Starbucks, I showed up at 8:30 AM on Sunday for my first shift. I was told to do all the modules in MyLearning‚Ä¶ which I did for four hours straight, on my own, until my SSV told me my shift was done. No trainer, no questions, no nothing‚ÄîI came back, and for the next two weeks, would be asked to do something, ask how to do it, and get dropped off into whatever it was, told to let them know if I had any questions. :)))

I had a total of 1 hour explanation about how to make drinks (plus some of the barista basics) and uhhh that was it. I‚Äôm now routinely on DT, dishes, and the dreaded front/warming Sunday morning combo.

starbucks,"as soon as I clocked in, this kid came in and threw up all over the floor right by the register. then he tracked it out the door.

we closed the cafe so hazmat can come and clean it. therefore anyone picking up mobile orders, or anyone who wants to order anything, has to use the drive thru.

i was solo drive thru for a while. i tried my best to get people in and out as quick as i could, but it's still chaos. people drove off because of the line, people needed remakes for one stupid reason or another, people added stuff at the window.

one lady ordered 7 food items, then added one at the window. i looked down towards the ovens, and there was NO ONE THERE. WHERE THE FUCK WAS OUR FOOD PERSON.

nonstop frappuccinos. nonstop refreshers. nonstop questions. someone walks up to the window and says ""i need to pick up my mobile order but do i have to wait in that whole line???"" i say ""i can get it for you this time but this is a huge safety hazard"". at least she says thank you.

we're all irritable and hate that today is like this. thus, we're snapping at each other. i try to keep calm but I'm actually losing my entire mind.

my hand off plane is cluttered because someone decided to put mobiles there instead of where they usually go, facing the cafe. it makes sense but my hand off plane is approx 1/3 of the top of a fridge. it's very small and can barely hold just drive thru orders. it gets crowded and confusing very quickly.

someone gets put on dto while i move to register. since i only ever solo drive thru, i keep organizing and grabbing drinks from under her even though she's supposed to hand them to me. now what do i do if i don't organize orders and grab straws myself??

there's trays of food all over the back room including on The Chair, so i have to sit in the cafe for my 10.

As a longtime patron of Starbucks, I just have to say that the rampant corporate greed/‚Äúgreedflation‚Äù I‚Äôve been observing is very off putting. This morning, one of your partners told me that many drink prices have been increasing by $0.50 approximately every 6 months - and this despite a 30%+ increase in profit. Do you all really think that all of your loyal customers just fell off the turnip truck and don‚Äôt notice? Are you not at all concerned with optics?? Global supply chain issues and inflation can‚Äôt be the reason for regular price increases when profits are soaring. As a result, I have scaled back my visits considerably, strictly because of the principle of the matter. I am aware of much of the good that Starbucks does in the world, but price gouging your customers, more and more as time goes on, is not the way. I hope to receive a thoughtful response, not a canned, copied and pasted one, and it would be nice to just feel good again someday about my patronage of Starbucks. I still go occasionally, but I‚Äôd go much more often if the price gouging didn‚Äôt leave such a sour taste in my mouth.",My email to corporate; How do we get through to the top?!

Today, my store manager said that it was a company policy to always have mobiles on, and he wasn't going to turn them off ever again.

At this point I'm not sure if he's lying because we have to turn mobiles off like 4x/week (not all day-like turn them off from 10-3 while we're short or whatever) or if that's actually a real policy that they've enacted.

- You need to find someone to cover your shift. ‚úñÔ∏è
Answer: No, that's a management's job. A staff alone does not have the hiring power or tell other colleagues to cover for them while those colleagues are on their day off. ‚úÖ

- Denied break time because we are busy. ‚úñÔ∏è

starbucks,"People who order light ice (especially through the drive through with having to constantly hear them chime in ‚Äúoh and can I get that with light ice‚Äù) are usually just a small pet peeve of mine and TBF I usually do not mind and will regularly give people light ice and fill their drinks above the third line anyways. HOWEVER. Today, combined with how much of a mess our POS was, really made me grow a special immense dislike for people who are insistent on getting light ice.

1. Getting light ice is NOT a ‚Äúsneaky hack‚Äù to get more drink. If your barista is making your drink correctly, there would still be the same amount of drink. If you are still getting your drinks filled to the top, be grateful that you have a nice barista.

Just today, I had two people in drive complain about their drink not being light ice. This one girl, who came back through the drive through twenty minutes after her initial order, apparently had ‚Äúonly realized that she had ordered light ice after she finished the drink‚Äù. LIKE I CANNOT EVEN LIE. When she told me this at the window, I was literally speechless. She was pointing at this completely empty venti cup with only ice left in it (and not even that much, probably less than the standard amt) telling me that she had wanted it with light ice and wanted us to remake it. She also told me her impossible sandwich was over cooked, rubbery, and she wanted us to remake that as well. 

The second case was about this lady who ordered two paradise drinks. I hand one out to her. She asks me, ‚ÄúIs this light ice?‚Äù I tell her yes. She looks at me, shakes her head, and says ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt light ice.‚Äù I remake it for her except she was rude to me so there‚Äôs a little bit of room at the top. I hand it out with the other one (WHICH LITERALLY HAD LIKE AN INCH OF ICE. Like this was such light ice. Didn‚Äôt even reach the third line) and she goes ‚ÄúAre you serious? You can‚Äôt hand people drinks like this. Get me your manager.‚Äù And this lady was my last customer before I clocked out of a 5 hour shift where I was ONLY on DTO. 

Be nice to your baristas. Outside of standard company practices and doing our job, we aren‚Äôt obligated to go above and beyond for you especially if you‚Äôre rude to us.

The way my shift lead (who at the time of the two instances had only been on the floor for like an hour or so and I was the partner who had been there the longest so far after the openers had left!!) handled these two events, the POS problems, and ME (the only partner that was actually having to deal w the POS issues on SOLO DRIVE) was unsupportive and plain mean.

starbucks,When starsucks had a policy that they followed they became successful in a godly level. And now they shouldn't even be in business. They have made a complete 180 in terms of what made them so big. Biggest complaint is the outlets being covered. That was one of the things that made starsucks so special. And the customer service used to leave you feeling like you were served by angels. Now it really doesn't seem like they want people in the store at all. They just want drive thrus.  Well if I'm gonna pay 6-8 bucks for a drink then I kinda want to enjoy it and maybe plug in my laptop for 20 to 30 min and leave . It used to be so nice to always know you could go inside and it felt like home kind of.  I definitely didn't mind paying more for coffee that honestly tastes like crap.  So I ask all that are fed up with how they have become to go buy your coffee and anything else you normally get somewhere else.  Somewhere that the company actually appreciates there customers. McDonald's has become better than starsucks . I predict in 5 to 10 years the only time you will see the name starsucks will be at a grocery store next to the sara Lee goods in the freezers. I was loyal to this company for almost 20 years and now I will never spend 1 more cent at this place.,Boycott starsucks!!

I took a sip and tasted very very sweet cotton candy flavored milk. I unsuccessfully tried to stir it up as it all seemed to settle on the bottom. The rest of the drink tasted like straight milk.

If it's quiet in store and I have a large Delivery order, I'll happily bring the in store customers drinks to the front of the queue, but otherwise, the drinks will be added to the queue in the order they are received. 

Sometimes if we are particularly busy, at least at my store, it will be one person's job to pack the delivery orders and hand them to the drivers. 
You are a customer. You are not my supervisor. Do not tell me ""Can you actually deal with REAL customers rather than waste my time on these silly deliveries."" 
No. Making drinks for those who prefer to order through a delivery service is part of my job and they're as valid a customer as you are. If I continue to pull in store customers drinks forward, then the delivery drivers will be kept waiting and will likely be complained at by the recipient of the delivery drinks.

I'm on my break after a busy morning so this probably isn't worded properly but hearing a Mother say to her kid 'These are delivery frappuccinos. The staff don't know how to prioritize their customers.' and being told to ""Serve real customers first!"" when my Supervisor told me to focus on the many deliveries we had - it's just extra stress.

You don't like the extra wait? I'm not keen on extra workload whilst remaining on ¬£9.50 per hour. You get to go out in the sun with your Frappuccinos in less than 3 minutes. I have to stand here all day making more drinks. Have a little patience.

starbucks,"A few days ago I had a customer come into the store &amp; they asked for a pour over. I go ahead a ring them up their coffee &amp; let them know that it will be ready in a few minutes to which they go &amp; say it‚Äôs okay &amp; asks to have a cup of water while they wait for the coffee. All was going well we even had a small conversation as I got the things to make his drink. 

Then my ssv comes over and tells me why I‚Äôm doing a pour over when I could have just done a whole batch of coffee. I tell them ‚Äúbecause the customer asked for a pour over‚Äù and we leave it at that. I soon get started on the drink and when I turn around I see the ssv staring at me while they are talking with another barista &amp; I hear them say ‚ÄúI told her to just do a batch‚Äù &amp; clearly rolls their eyes at me.

starbucks,"I don‚Äôt know what to do. I love my coworkers (which is why I‚Äôm still here) and food, drink, and coffee mark-outs save me a lot on grocery money. But this place is killing me. 

We aren‚Äôt scheduled enough people on the floor. If we have even one call out (which 2+ is common because we are all so burnt out) we‚Äôre absolutely screwed. 3 people on the floor (4 if we‚Äôre lucky) during peak and then we‚Äôre yelled at about slow dt times and CSR cards not being completed. ONE person making drinks for mobile, dt, and cafe orders because our manager refuses to turn off mobiles most days. We‚Äôre the busiest store near us and the burn out is real. 

Our store is in the process of unionizing but nothing is finalized yet. About half our partners are ready to walk out (since we‚Äôre in an area where walkouts have been happening recently) and we‚Äôve had 5 partners quit or who are in the process of quitting in the next 2 weeks. One of those partners has been with the company for years and is so tired of it. 

I work mornings and I‚Äôm exhausted. I dread going to work, I sob in the bathrooms/in my car on breaks, and my mental health (which has been suffering due to personal reasons the past 6 months) is getting so much worse. I‚Äôm having migraines most days, throwing up from stress and anxiety from the thought of going to work, and when I‚Äôm not working I can‚Äôt get out of bed. I‚Äôm scared to call out because my manager can be temperamental with call outs. I was scheduled a PDC with my manager over a month ago where I was going to bring up
these concerns and she told me we were too busy and understaffed to have it that day and she‚Äôll reschedule it.

starbucks,"Hey folks, I used to work at a Starbucks a really long time ago. Honestly, I don't remember much lol.

Fast-foward to 2022, the job market has been pretty tight and I just can't seem to land any interviews. I saw a job posting for Starbucks and fortunately I am now scheduled for a phone interview. 


So a little about me... I used to manage an artisanal coffee shop for about 4.5 years. Obviously I don't manage anymore, because the owner decided to move on from the business. We had a kitchen... so including the kitchen staff, we had around 12-14 staff members. We served alcohol, brunch, held private events, etc. Once a year, staff and I would participate in a local coffee festival, we get to do free pour latte art all day, so that was fun.


Some of our ""main"" gears at the store were:
- Kees van der Western Spirit espresso machine
- Mazzer Super Jolly grinder x 3 (2 on rotation, 1 decaf)
- Acaia Digital Scale x 2 (for dry weight)
- Acaia Luna Espresso scale x 2 (for wet weight)
- Poursteady pourover machine

In terms of coffee quality assurance:
- TDS drip twice a day (done on the first batch)
- TDS pourover that's on current rotation twice a day (this was so annoying lol)
- Grind adjustment twice a day (dry weight vs wet weight, pull time)
- Taste check espresso, drip, pourover to make sure it's within roasters' taste profile

In terms of management duties, the usual stuff... product roadmap (we launched our own coldbrew, gelato &amp; vegan icecream...) scheduling, answering daily emails, dealing with daily unexpected issues, balancing store rent/labor/other profit margins, running to the bank, weekly planning with our baker and kitchen staff, communicating with our accountant, trying to find new roasters that may fit with our customer's tastebuds, staff training, bi-weekly order (beans, fresh ingredients, alcohol, etc, etc).

starbucks,"i‚Äôve been working at sbux since february and transferred to a new location in june. the manager at my new location is very hard to talk to and very inconsiderate. i originally had asked for an LOA for school, family, and health issues around for the next few week around two weeks ago. she said she can‚Äôt grant the LOA to me because she doesn‚Äôt have enough staff and ‚Äúwe could work together to find a solution‚Äù. i said ok i‚Äôm fine with that but instead she schedules me for 31 hours the week before school and the week school starts. i‚Äôm getting frustrated because she keeps insisting that i have to find my own coverage if i can‚Äôt come to those shifts. i‚Äôm done. i cant handle this job anymore. i‚Äôm physically and emotionally exhausted and tired. i want to quit before work next wednesday. i cant find any coverage because everyone at my store has two jobs or school. i know i should put a two weeks in but i‚Äôm literally tied. i cannot work 60+ hours in the span of two weeks. i do want to come back and work at sbux again so i‚Äôm very confused. any advice? will i have problems getting rehired if i don‚Äôt give a two weeks??",quitting the job-i need advice
starbucks,"Hey guys who didn‚Äôt get theirs on time- I finally got mine at around 9 AM this morning. I bank with Capital One and they emailed me that Starbucks made a deposit and I was able to see how much as well and the raise is definitely on there. I still can‚Äôt log in to my account though because capital one locked me out for 24 hours yesterday! So I‚Äôm just gonna trust them on this one. 

Where are you guys at? Anyone else get money yet? Pretty upsetting this happened. Not trying to promote anything (so don‚Äôt come investigate me Starbucks)- I‚Äôm just thinking that this is one of the reasons why people want a union.",Finally received my paycheck
