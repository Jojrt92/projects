    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon is an American multinational technology company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. In 2020, Amazon captured 32 percent of all beauty and skin care bought online, with $23 billion in total sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Covid-19 pandemic has boosted the sale online purchases in general globally, with consumers found themselves spending their time in quarrantine. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some stats taken from: https://www.powerreviews.com/insights/2021-beauty-industry-consumer-report/\n",
    "\n",
    "- 87% of people say they spend more or the same online than before Covid\n",
    "- 49% say they now spend more than $50 online on beauty products; compared to 16% in the previous year (2019)\n",
    "- 57% of shoppers say that they had never tried more of a quarter of the beauty products they bought online in 2020 (i.e. they were first time purchases)\n",
    "- 41% say they rely on reviews more than they did pre-Covid\n",
    "- **76% focusing on buying products that are sustainably made**\n",
    "- **54% (more than half) of consumers indicate they wear less makeup now than pre-COVID**\n",
    "\n",
    "One pattern was observed that, during Covid, more than half of the consumers claimed that they wore less makeup, yet beauty product sales has soared. On the other hand, survey suggest that the consumers do care about products that are sustainably made, yet on a personal level, consumers are buying in **excess**"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumers are concerned about beauty products manufactured and the impact it does to the environment, yet they are indulging in buying new products that are pushed to them via attractive sales or word of mouths recommendations from influencers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to address a consumer's desire to create less waste from beauty products by encourageing them to purchase more sensibly via a recommendation system that contains reviews and scores of a product that were gathered from an Amazon user's raw inputs.\n"
