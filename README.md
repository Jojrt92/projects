**Text Classifier for Subreddit**

Project Description:
This project is built with the aim to classify and predict which subreddit based on a text input. 10,000 rows of data are scrapped from the reddit API of subreddit Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. 
**It's the Halloween season of 2022, Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts are both competitors in the Coffeeshop chain industry and both brands have launched their seasonal Halloween themed products.**
